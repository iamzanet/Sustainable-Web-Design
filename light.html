    <h2> 1. Sustainability and the web </h2>
    <p>When we think about the web, we often think of it as a green medium. We think of digital products as the lightweight counterpart to physical products. Because of terms such as “web” and “cloud”, we often think of the internet as ephemeral. Given the seemingly immaterial nature of the Internet, <strong>it is easy to think that our digital actions have no impact on the physical environment.</strong> </p>
    <p>Ever so mindlessly we scroll through our endless social media feeds, binge watch funny cat videos or Netflix, upload tons of holiday pictures and videos, take thousands of selfies which we then store on the weightless “cloud”, without ever looking at them again. </p>
    <p> We only notice the size of our data, when our devices or cloud services run out of storage space, and then, instead of deleting useless data, which is very time-consuming, we rather buy a new device with more storage or we upgrade our online storage, because it is cheap and more convenient. </p>
    <p><strong>Our digital behaviour is in fact extremely wasteful.</strong> I believe this is mostly due to the fact that we are unaware of the physicality of the digital. Most people don’t know how the internet, particularly the technology behind it, works. Generally, <strong>there is a lack of awareness for how much energy is needed to power the internet.</strong> Not to mention the amount of energy and natural resources that are needed to create the devices we use to access it. Most people have not seen the massive data centres which store our data, nor the mines that extract the raw materials used in our electronics and the lakes of toxic waste that go along with it. Even when we are aware of it, it seems distant. As the saying goes: out of sight, out of mind.g, we rather buy a new device with more storage or we upgrade our online storage, because it is cheap and more convenient.</p>
    <p>Where there is energy consumption and resource extraction, there is pollution. Most of our energy still comes from very polluting sources: fossil fuels. According to the International Energy Agency only 29% of energy came from renewable sources in 2020, and it was estimated to grow by further 8% in 2021.(1)  “<strong>The internet is the largest coal-powered machine ever created</strong>,” as Tom Greenwood puts it in his book Sustainable Web Design.(2) </p>
    <p>The amount of energy the internet uses is significant. As of 2019,<strong> the ICT (Information and communication technology) sector was estimated to use up around 10% of global energy consumption</strong> - around 2 500 TWh(3)  out of 22 848 TWh(4). And that number is likely to grow as existing data centres are about to reach their theoretical limit of power usage effectiveness.(5)  <strong>Energy intensity of the digital industry in the world is increasing</strong> (4% per year), contrary to conventional industrial growth, which is becoming less energy intensive by 1.8% a year(6). The explosion of data traffic — especially video traffic from streaming and cloud gaming — is happening at a speed that surpasses energy efficiency improvement rate in equipment, networks and data centres. </p>
    <p> Hand in hand with immense energy consumption goes the carbon footprint of the web. According to Climatecare.org,<strong> the internet is currently responsible for around 3,7% of global CO2 emissions </strong>(7).  In comparison, the global aviation industry accounts for 2,1% CO2 emissions(8).  A 2018 study published in the Journal of Cleaner Production estimates that ICT emissions could grow up to 14% by 2040(9),  which is as much as China is currently emitting. According to Shift Project “consuming one euro of digital technology in 2018 induces direct and indirect energy consumption 37% higher than what it was in 2010. This trend is the exact opposite of what is generally attributed to digital technology and runs counter to the objectives of energy and climatic decoupling set by the Paris Agreement.“(10)</p>
    <p>In order to tackle this problem, we need to understand that<strong> the digital is also physical </strong>and that <strong>what we do on the internet manifests in the real world</strong>. In his book World Wide Waste Gerry McGovern writes: “Digital is no innocent bystander. Digital matters. Digital is shaping our lives. Digital is shaping our planet. Digital is an accelerant and a concentrator. Right now, it is accelerating bad behavior and concentrating wealth.”(11) </p>
    <p> In a way, <strong>t</strong><strong>he digital world is yet another manifestation of our consumeristic and highly wasteful behaviour.</strong> We create digital waste in form of data, we overconsume digital media because it is “free” or cheap. But <strong>“free” and cheap comes at the cost of our planet</strong>. It shows up in the environment as toxic factory waste and greenhouse emissions.</p>
    <p> Currently there are no web standards concerned with energy consumption or carbon footprint. This needs to change if we want to stand a chance against the climate crisis. <strong>As the internet gains more and more prominence in our lives, we need to make sure it can be sustained in the future.</strong></p>

    <h2> 1.1 Definition of sustainability </h2>
    <p> <strong> Sustainability is a very complex issue.</strong> It is often thought of as a three-dimensional matter, the three pillars being the environmental, the social, and the economic. <strong>It encompasses nature conservation, food supply, economic development models, reduction of poverty, access to healthcare and education </strong>and many more issues.</p>
    <p>Although the term sustainability has gained a lot of prominence in the last decade, the concept itself is nothing new. According to Wikipedia: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p> “The idea [of sustainability] itself goes back to times immemorial, as communities have always worried about the capacity of their environment to sustain them in the long term. <strong>Many ancient cultures had traditions restricting the use of natural resources,</strong> e.g. the Māori of New Zealand, the Amerindians of coastal British Columbia and peoples of Indonesia, Oceania, India and Mali.”(12)</p>
    </div>
    <p> The term sustain (verb) comes from Old French (c. 1300) sostenir, meaning “give support to". The origin of this word comes from the Latin word sustinere, meaning "hold up, hold upright; furnish with means of support; bear, undergo, endure". From the early 15th century, the meaning was to "endure without failing or yielding."(13) </p>
    <p> Term sustainability as we use it today was defined in a 1987 report titled Our Common Future written by the United Nations Commission on Environment and Development (known also as the Brundtland Commission). It defined sustainable development as “<strong>development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</strong>"(14)  It is likely the most quoted definition of sustainability. The term sustainable development was further institutionalized in 2015 when 193 nations across the world signed The Paris Agreement. It was agreed that the Sustainable Development Goals were to be achieved by all countries by 2030.</p>
    <p> It could be argued that the Brundtland definition is flawed and even idealistic because it lies on the premise that present day needs are being met. <strong>We live in a world which creates artificial needs instead of meeting people’s real needs.</strong> Thanks to clever marketing methods, we are being convinced that we need all kind of material possessions in order to feel complete. We are being bombarded by hundreds of ads daily advertising this or that product, in this way artificial needs are created and subsequently satisfied by overconsumption of cheap, often unethically produced goods. <strong>People’s real needs, such as the need for general wellbeing, education, freedom, safety, friendship, love and connection are largely being ignored.</strong></p>
    <p> Many critics nowadays consider the term “sustainable development” to be an oxymoron (a figure of speech which juxtaposes concepts with opposing meanings), due to the fact that c<strong>onsumer societies are socially and ecologically self-destructive.</strong> James H. Brown, in his article The Oxymoron of Sustainable Development, argues that: “<strong>Continual population growth and economic development on a finite Earth are biophysically impossible</strong>. They violate the laws of physics, especially thermodynamics, and the fundamental principles of biology.”(15)</p>
    <p> Dennis Meadows, one of the authors of the 1972 influential publication The Limits to Growth said in a 2012 interview for the Smithsonian: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“When I use the term sustainable development — which I consider to be an oxymoron actually — I am trying to capture the meaning that most people seem to have. People who use the term mean, essentially, that this would be a phase of development where they get to keep what they have but all the poor people can catch up. Or, they get to keep doing what they’ve been doing, but through the magic of technology they are going to cause less damage to the environment and use fewer resources. Either way you use the term, it is just a fantasy. Neither of those is possible — anymore.”(16) </p>
    </div>
    <p> He also stresses the need for resilience as a mean of coping with the permanent loss of cheap energy or the permanent change in the climate that we are currently facing.</p>
    <p>One of the common responses to the many climate problems we are encountering as a result of not implementing sustainable solutions earlier is the idea that we will surely find a way to deal with them through the use and development of technology. But <strong>technology cannot prevent the collapse of our planet and societies by itself.</strong> According to Meadows: “It requires cultural and social changes as well. You need to stabilize the population, and you need to shift consumption preferences away from material goods to the nonmaterial part — love, freedom, friendship, self-understanding and things like that.“ (17) </p>
    <p>Some <strong>scholars suggest it is time to move past the concept of sustainability </strong>because of the realities of the Anthropocene such as the unprecedented and irreversible rates of human-induced biodiversity loss, exponential increases in per-capita resource consumption, and global climate change. Benson and Craig write in their 2014 publication The End of Sustainability:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“We must face the impossibility of defining — let alone pursuing—a goal of “sustainability” in a world characterized by such extreme complexity, radical uncertainty and lack of stationarity. After briefly examining sustainability's failure, we <strong>propose resilience thinking as one possible new orientation</strong> and point to the challenges associated with translating resilience theory into policy application.”(18) </p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>The exhaustion of the concept of sustainability coincides with the rebirth of more radical ideas such as liberation from capitalism, consumerism and the logic of growth</strong>. In his article, Post-capitalism, post-growth, post-consumerism? Eco-political hopes beyond sustainability, Blühdorn asks: “May the exhaustion of the sustainability paradigm finally re-open the intellectual and political space for the big push beyond the established socio-economic order?”(19) </p>
    <p>It is becoming very clear that <strong>present economic activities significantly reduce the options for future generations.</strong> Many young activist groups such as Fridays for Future or Extinction Rebellion voice their concerns about the future of young people, our planet, and animal species including humans. It might already be too late for sustainable solutions and climate neutrality. <strong>Rather than sustaining an exhausted and degraded planet, it may be time to develop services and products that are resistant, renewable and regenerative</strong>. According to Thrive Design Studio:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Regenerative development requires us to embody a state of non-duality, or union, with the rest of life. It compels us to work as nature, opposed to merely doing things to nature. This entails going even deeper than the leading edge of systems thinking (the uncovering of the interconnected and complex nature of the world) and into the realm of systems being. It recognizes that <strong>we are the system, that there is and can never be any separation of humans from the web of life that we wholly depend upon</strong>. When we release toxins into the environment, we quickly discover them infiltrating our own bodies through the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe. <strong>In essence, what we do to nature, we do to ourselves.</strong>”(20) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Sustainability is an incredibly complicated concept, and even though its definition may be flawed and its goals aren’t always easily definable and measurable, it is still something we as a society should strive for and beyond. For lack of a better word, I will use “sustainable” throughout this thesis with a meaning derived from the Brundtland report, while being aware that <strong>almost no human development is truly sustainable in the long term under the current conditions</strong>. The practices and solutions proposed will not be 100% sustainable, but “more sustainable” than business as usual scenarios. </p>
    <p> In the contemporary discourse of sustainability, some key words keep repeating themselves. T<strong>he ideas of regeneration, renewability and resilience play a crucial role in web sustainability</strong>, too. In the following chapters these topics will be emerging times and times again. <strong>Another important concept tied to web sustainability is efficiency.</strong> Tim Frick writes in Designing for Sustainability:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“More sustainable solutions are also more efficient solutions. More efficient solutions typically yield greater success. […] <strong>The most sustainable solution is one that quickly provides the most pertinent content across the widest array of devices, purportedly as far into the future as possible</strong>.“(21) </p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <br>
  <article id="ch1.1.1">
    <h3>Greenwashing</h3>
    <p><strong>Greenwashing is a deceptive practice that is tightly linked with sustainability</strong>. Its definition is as follows:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p> “Greenwashing is essentially when a company or organisation spends more time and money on marketing themselves as being sustainable than on actually minimising their environmental impact. It’s a deceitful advertising method to gain favour with consumers who choose to support businesses that care about bettering the planet. <strong>Greenwashing takes up valuable space in the fight against environmental issues</strong>, like climate change, plastic ocean pollution, air pollution and global species extinctions.”(22)</p>
    </div>
    <p> <strong> Sustainability claims are often hard to proof check and can be hard to disprove</strong> and many organizations, particularly business take advantage of this. According to sustainability consultant JD Capuano, “every company with a green claim is greenwashing. Our current economic system is based on unlimited growth, but our resources are limited. <strong>Even a company that makes the most responsible products can still have significant environmental impact</strong>.”(23)</p>
  </article>
  <br>
  <article id="ch1.2">
    <h2> How sustainable is the digital? </h2>
    <p>“When you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck; when you invent the plane you also invent the plane crash; and when you invent electricity, you invent electrocution. Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress.”(24) </p>
    <p> Paul Virilio </p>
    <br>
    <p><strong> Every new technology brings with it positive and negative aspects.</strong> The information and communication technologies (ICT) have undoubtedly brought significant improvements and advancements to our lives. Because of it, we have now an easy access to information, education and many useful tools. On the other side of the coin, there rest the negative effects of ICT on our mental and physical health, bigger scarcity of jobs due to their replacement by technology, the spread of misinformation, growth of material consumerism and last but not least the continued destruction of our natural environment as a result of our digital actions. </p>
<p><strong>The majority of the internet is unsustainable</strong>. This chapter sheds light on the unsustainable nature of current practices of data collection and storage, web design and publishing, device life cycles, etc.; and discusses various proposed solutions to these issues.</p>
    <p>“<strong>If the internet were a country, it would be the sixth most polluting country in the world</strong>, with annual emissions similar to those of Germany,”(25) Greenwood writes. The pollution comes from energy consumption and/or manufacturing, transportation, maintenance of:</p>
    <p> 1.	Data centres (48% energy use)<br>
      2.	Transmission networks (14% energy use)<br>
      3.	End user devices (38% energy use)(26)</p>
    <p> In 2018, data centres used up about 200 TWh of energy.(27) That amounts to about 1% of global energy consumption. This energy is needed to process, store and cool down our data. Shockingly, multiple sources point to the fact that <strong>around 90% of all digital data is waste and never gets used</strong>. Gerry McGovern writes on the subject:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Up to 90% of digital data is not used. We collect. We store. We create and then don’t use. Data is the atomic structure of digital. Words, music, images, films, videos, software. It all ends up as data. Most data is like single-use, throwaway plastic. <strong>What sort of society accepts 90% waste?</strong> Around 90% of data is never accessed three months after it is first stored, according to Tech Target. 80% of all digital data is never accessed or used again after it is stored, according to a 2018 report by Active Archive Alliance. Businesses typically only analyze around 10% of the data they collect, according to search technology specialist Lucidworks. 90% of unstructured data is never analyzed, according to IDC. 90% of all sensor data collected from Internet of Things devices is never used, according to IBM.”(28) </p>
    </div>
    <p> This percentage also corresponds to the results of a 2018 study by Ahrefs which found that <strong>91% of all pages they analysed got zero traffic from Google</strong>.(29) A huge amount of energy use and corresponding pollution could be spared if this data and web pages would be deleted.</p>
    <p> The amount of data we generate and store is becoming problematic, because it is growing at an unprecedented pace. Whereas in 2016, 44 billion GB of data was created globally per day, it is estimated that by 2025 more than 10 times as much data will be generated per day.  <strong>90% of the data on the internet has been created since 2016</strong>, according to an IBM Marketing Cloud study.(30) And there are no signs of this phenomenon slowing down. IoT and AI, both hungry for data and power, are growing at a rapid speed. As a result of that, <strong>internet traffic is growing exponentially</strong>.</p>
    <p> Because processing power and storage have gotten so cheap, <strong>it is often convenient and more economic to store rather than review and delete old data.</strong> Because computing time is not seen as precious as human working time, most organizations nowadays do not focus on reducing and minimizing their digital data. It is cheaper to pay for more processing power and storage than to dedicate a portion of their employees time for reviewing data.</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p> “In 1956, the IBM 350 storage disk drive was the size of a large wardrobe and stored about 3.75 MB of data. You could rent it for $3,200 per month. In 1967, a one-megabyte hard drive cost about one million US dollars. That meant that content writers really thought about the words and images needed. It meant that software developers really thought about every line of code they wrote. By 2020, Google Drive was offering 15 GB of storage for free and 100 GB for $1.99 per month. […] Cheap storage combined with cheap processing power made the World Wide Web the World Wide Waste,” argues McGovern.(31) </p>
    </div>
    <p>But <strong>the practice of storing large amounts of useless data is unsustainable.</strong> By saving time now and storing it up, we diminish the future, and the opportunities of the future generations. Because the resources of our planet are finite, running out of storage space eventually seems inevitable, if we continue to collect data at this pace. It seems unwise to rely on future technologies that have not been invented yet to solve our problems. <strong>We need to start reviewing, sorting and cleaning old data, removing old, out of date content, webpages and apps.</strong> “We must overcome the pervasive idea that digital removes from us the responsibility to organize things and to clean up after ourselves. This is a truly deep, pernicious and corrupting idea.” McGovern writes.(32)</p>
    <p> Hand in hand with better processing power, faster networks and cheap storage goes the trend of creating increasingly energy-hungry and heavy-loaded websites and apps. <strong>The median page weight has increased from 500 kB in 2011 to over 2.1 MB in 2021 for desktop. For mobile, the increase is even larger – from 200 kB to 1.9 MB</strong> in the same time period. As a result, the page load time has increased significantly on mobile devices - the average page loading speed in April 2022 was 18.8 seconds, whereas 10 years earlier, it was 5.4 seconds.(33) </p>
    <p> <strong> Images account for approximately half of all data transfer on the average website</strong>, and are therefore the largest factor contributing to the carbon emissions of the average page. According to websitecarbon.com, t<strong>he average web page tested produces 1.76 grams CO2 per page view</strong>. For a website with 10,000 monthly page views, that amounts to 211 kg CO2 per year.(34)</p>
    <p> <strong> Energy efficiency is still not an aspect that is being considered by many web creators</strong>. Elements such as video backgrounds, image carousels, rotating banner ads, high resolution images and other frontend decorations are a common practice. When being viewed on slower internet connections or older devices these overloaded pages load slow, waste energy, and frustrate the users. It has been proven by many studies that users are not likely to wait more than a couple of seconds. The longer the wait, the higher the bounce rate . If a user leaves the page, then all the energy it took to load it was wasted while no goal was achieved. Greenwood writes on the subject: “<strong>While most technologies become ever more energy efficient, including the underlying technology of the web such as data centres and transmission networks, websites themselves are a technology that becomes less efficient as time goes on</strong>.”(35)</p>
    <p> <strong>Not only websites are growing in size. Mobile apps are constantly growing larger too.</strong> The top 10 iPhone apps by downloads in the US were 298% or nearly four times larger in 2021 than in 2016, requiring 2.2 GB of storage, compared to about 550 MB in 2016.</p>
    <p>But why is this bloat necessary? Are the apps and webpages improved in terms of quality, loading speed and value? Software engineer Nikita Prokopov discusses this development in his 2018 article titled Software Disenchantment:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p> “An Android system with no apps takes up almost 6 GB. Just think for a second about how obscenely HUGE that number is. What’s in there, HD movies? I guess it’s basically code: kernel, drivers. Some string and resources too, sure, but those can’t be big. So, how many drivers do you need for a phone? </p>
      <p> Windows 95 was 30MB. Today we have web pages heavier than that! Windows 10 is 4GB, which is 133 times as big. But is it 133 times as superior? I mean, functionally they are basically the same. […] But whatever Windows 10 is, is Android really 150% of that? Google’s keyboard app routinely eats 150 MB. Is an app that draws 30 keys on a screen really five times more complex than the whole Windows 95? </p>
      <p> A 16GB Android phone was perfectly fine 3 years ago. Today, with Android 8.1, it’s barely usable because <strong>each app has become at least twice as big for no apparent reason. There are no additional features. They are not faster or more optimized. They don’t look different. They just…grow?</strong>“(36)</p>
    </div>
    <p> There seems to be no logical explanation, the only answer might be: because it is possible. <strong>There is an abundance of cheap storage.</strong> Prokopov argues in his article that this <strong>bloat is simply a matter of poor and lazy programming.</strong></p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p> „Engineering is understanding performance, structure, limits of what you build, deeply. Combining poorly written stuff with more poorly written stuff goes strictly against that. To progress, we need to understand what and why are we doing. […] So everything is just a pile of barely working code added on top of previously written barely working code. It keeps growing in size and complexity, diminishing any chance for a change. <strong>To have a healthy ecosystem you need to go back and revisit</strong>. You need to occasionally throw stuff away and replace it with better stuff.“(37)</p>
    </div>
    <p> <strong> Quick fixes and unreliability seem to be too common in software development.</strong> According to Frick “The duct-tape method of coding new features is unfortunately more common than one might think and is decidedly not a very sustainable approach.”(38)  There is no time to build things right, to build services that are reliable, resistant, energy efficient and functioning well into the future. Too often it seems that the only viable option for the user to avoid bad performance issues and running out of storage is to get a new device. I<strong>t appears as if the tech industry was built on the premise of waste</strong>. Both web technologies and devices are becoming obsolete at an unprecedented pace, leaving behind large amounts of electronic waste. “<strong>Obsolescence issues are a key driver of production excess</strong>,” Izabella Kaminska writes, “as successive versions of operating systems are compatible with older generation of terminals only at the cost of degraded performance, or a significant reduction in the useful capacity of the battery.”(39) <strong>Innovation for the sake of innovation is another driving force in the tech industry.</strong> McGovern argues</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p> “The culture of tech is the culture of change, newness, innovation. The business model depends on super-short lifespans for hardware and software. For the tech industry, growth comes through waste. In tech, nothing is built to last. Everything is built to waste because the driving idea is that there is a new innovation around the corner that will change everything.”(40) </p>

    <p> According to most sources <strong>more than 50 million metric tons of e-waste is being produced every year</strong>. Around 6.7 Mt of this waste is composed of screens and monitors - including televisions, laptops, notebooks, and tablets. Further 4.7 Mt of this waste is made up of small IT and telecoms equipment like smartphones(41), and that number is expected to continue rising. It is estimated that only around 13-17% of e-waste is properly recycled. It is especially difficult and expensive to recycle e-waste since it is usually made up of a very complex mix of materials. <strong>Recycling does not address the real issues, namely overproduction and overconsumption.</strong> On average, people exchange their smartphones every 21 months.(42)  That is problematic, because <strong>most of the pollution caused by a smartphone comes from its manufacturing due to high energy costs</strong>. Mark Wilson writes:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p> „The problem is that building a new smartphone–and specifically, mining the rare materials inside them–represents 85% to 95% of the device’s total CO2 emissions for two years. That means buying one new phone takes as much energy as recharging and operating a smartphone for an entire decade.“(43) </p>
    </div>
    <p> <strong>Electronic waste is extremely dangerous.</strong> According to The World Counts, e-waste comprises 70% of our overall toxic waste. Furthermore, the waste is buried or burned in landfills, with toxins polluting the land, air and water. If the waste undergoes recycling consisting of the extraction of precious metals, it happens on e-waste sites in developing countries, where workers, many of them children, earn an average of $1.50 per day, and are mostly unprotected while working with the toxic substances.(44)</p>
    <p><strong>E-waste is directly connected to the unsustainable practices of digital services</strong>. Whenever designers and developers create a webpage or an app which requires a high CPU usage to run or takes up extreme amounts of storage, and therefore wastes energy and subsequently the device itself, the process of its conversion into waste speeds up. Whenever a software does not support older hardware, more potential e-waste is generated. </p>
    <p><strong>Linear economy is one of the main contributing factors to the sheer amount of waste being created and dumped on our planet.</strong> Linear economy follows a take-make-dispose pattern. <strong>Raw materials are taken, products are manufactured and sold, and after they are deemed no longer useful, they are disposed or thrown away. </strong>The producer has almost no responsibility for the product after it is sold. The same thing can be said about web publishing. McGovern writes on the topic:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p> “We live in a linear economy. The aim is to make the thing and sell the thing or publish the thing and then pretty much forget the thing. <strong>In our linear economy, waste is not the responsibility of the producer. This irresponsibility is having catastrophic impacts on our environment.</strong> In our linear economy, recycling is at best a bandage, at worst it’s a PR stunt. The linear economy has been enabled by cheap and seemingly abundant raw materials. Once manufacturers have no responsibility to continuously manage these materials throughout their entire life cycle, once they can create waste and have no responsibility for that waste, then things like single-use plastic and hard-to-repair-and-recycle smartphones become the logical outputs.”(45)</p>
    </div>
    <p> One of the proposed solutions to the problem is the adoption of circular economy. <strong>Circularity, unlike linearity, is a natural principle.</strong> Water, carbon and oxygen all flow in circular cycles and help to maintain the balance in ecosystems. Our planet has followed these circular patterns for millions of years, until complex human civilizations disturbed them, and caused serious natural imbalance. The results include climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution. <strong>Circular economy is a system that tackles these problems by eliminating waste and pollution, circulating products and materials at their highest value and regenerating nature.</strong> It is a resilient system that is good for business, people and the environment.(46) McGovern proposes these 3 circular thinking principles:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“1. You make it, you own it forever. It’s never old. You must take it back. Your old products become the raw material from which you build your new products.<br>
        2. You create data, you own it forever. You must look after it until the moment it is deleted. Any data without an owner gets automatically deleted.<br>
        3. You are measured on outcomes not inputs. What positive outcomes were you responsible for today?“(47) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Another proposed solution to the damaging environmental impact caused by unsustainability of digital technologies is the so-called “<strong>digital sobriety</strong>”. It <strong>urges both individual users and organizations to reconsider their digital behaviour and its impact.</strong> The Shift Project’s 2019 report Lean ICT – Towards Digital Sobriety defines the term as follows:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Reducing the energy and environmental footprint of digital technology requires returning to the individual and collective capacity to question the social and economic usefulness of our behaviors linked to purchasing and consuming digital objects and services, and to adapting them accordingly in order to avoid immoderation. Limiting the renewal of terminals as much as possible, avoiding the multiplication of digital copies and segmenting our video uses are essential actions. […] Purchasing the least powerful devices possible, and changing them as seldom as possible, while reducing superfluous energy consuming uses (bulky attachments, videos, etc.)”(48) </p>
    </div>
    <p>The preference of the “free” model is another prime example of wasteful digital consumeristic behaviour. It has been proven by many studies that users prefer to use web and app services that are free, but filled with advertising, rather than pay for them. This causes many downloads without consumption. According to research by Quettra, the average app loses 77% of its users in the first 3 days after it is installed, 90% after a month and 95% after 3 months.(49) <strong>Where there is no price to pay, there is no thought about usefulness. </strong>E-book maker Kobo found out that 60% of downloaded e-books were never opened. The research showed that the more expensive the book was, the more likely the reader would at least start reading it.(50) <strong>The correlation between the free model and waste could not be more obvious. </strong> </p>
    <p>As with any environmental issue, <strong>the question of who is responsible arises.</strong> <strong>Private companies tend to shift blame on users for irresponsible behaviour</strong>. It is common practice for companies to do so. “For instance, as Greenwood writes on the subject, “Keep America Beautiful managed to shift the entire debate around America’s garbage and litter problems away from the industry and onto consumers, and this strategy has been copied time and time again since.”(51) <strong>Individuals, in contrast, tend to blame their governments</strong>:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p> “Another argument is that it’s the responsibility of the government to tackle the environmental issues relating to the internet. I’ve heard it claimed that individual professionals and organizations cannot make any impact on their own, and that regulation is needed to limit the industry’s impact. We should remember the words of anthropologist Margaret Mead: ‘Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.’ So, if government intervention is needed, it should not be instead of individual efforts, but in addition to it.”(52) </p>
    </div>
    <p> <strong>In order to make real progress, instead of shifting responsibilities, it is necessary to make changes on all three levels: individual, organizational, and governmental</strong>. Individuals should try to minimize their impact by holding on to their devices longer, avoiding unnecessary downloads, keeping video streaming to minimum and reviewing and deleting old, not useful data files like photos and videos. Organizations should assess their digital impact and carbon footprint better and develop strategies to minimize the impact as well as provide digital services that are energy efficient, clean, useful and do not unnecessarily degrade users’ devices. In addition to that, governments should implement policies which take energy efficiency of digital assets into account, as well as implement laws that demand manufacturers to take back, repair and recycle or upcycle old devices. </p>
    <p>There needs to be a profound change in the way the internet is being treated as a space. Rachel He compares the internet to a public space and argues:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“<strong>I</strong><strong>f the internet is a public space, then we ought to treat it as the most valuable of its kind</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;an internet that lacks organization and cleanliness should bring us discomfort the way a polluted watering hole or neglected public restroom would. Instead, we have been reckless in the way we move about that public space, jeopardizing its future and that of our physical world.”(53) </p>
    </div>
    <p> <strong> There needs to be a higher level of awareness on the topic of web sustainability. </strong>School programs need to include web sustainability in their curriculums so that the next generations of designers, developers, content creators, and marketers automatically implement sustainable strategies in their digital products. Luckily, many web professionals are becoming more aware of the issues and are taking steps towards a more environmentally conscious internet. <strong>T</strong><strong>he Sustainable Web Manifesto(54) lists 6 principles for web sustainability: </strong></p>
    <p> <strong>1. Clean</strong> – The services we provide and services we use will be powered by renewable energy.</p>
    <p> <strong>2. Efficient </strong>– The products and services we provide will use the least amount of energy and material resources possible.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Open</strong> – The products and services we provide will be accessible, allow for the open exchange of information, and allow users to control their data.</p>
    <p> <strong>4. Honest</strong> – The products and services we provide will not mislead or exploit users in their design or content.</p>
    <p><strong>5. Regenerative</strong> – The products and services we provide will support an economy that nourishes people and planet.</p>
    <p><strong>6. Resilient</strong> – The products and services we provide will function in the times and places where people need them most.</p>

    <h2> Measuring the impact </h2>
    <p>Even though there are many statistics and estimations of the internet’s environmental impact, there is a lack of universally recognized methodologies and tools for calculating the impact of individual digital products. <strong>It is almost impossible to measure carbon emissions of web products and services.</strong> This is why it is hard for product owners to understand the impact of their product, and take action. Greenwood writes on the topic: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“We can’t measure the fumes coming out of the exhaust pipes on our laptops. The emissions of our websites are far away, out of sight and out of mind, coming out of power stations burning coal and gas. We have no way to trace the electrons from a website or app back to the power station where the electricity is being generated and actually know the exact amount of greenhouse gas produced. So what do we do?”(55) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Greenwood proposes the following <strong>measuring primary factors: data transfer and carbon intensity of electricity.</strong> Data transfer over the internet is usually measured in kilowatt-hours per gigabyte as a metric of energy efficiency. The more data is transferred, the more energy is used. Data transfer for a single visit of a web page can be estimated by measuring its page weight, which can be done using the developer tools in a browser. Web hosting accounts often include statistics about total data transfer.(56) </p>
    <p> Greenwood suggests that page weight and transfer size are more objective measures and more reliable benchmarks for sustainable web design, rather than fast performance, which tends to be more subjective in the perception of load times than about true efficiency. Greenwood summarizes data transfer as a measurement as follows:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p> “<strong>Reduced data transfer translates to energy efficiency, a key factor to reducing carbon emissions of web products</strong>. The more efficient our products, the less electricity they use, and the less fossil fuels need to be burned to produce the electricity to power them.”(57) </p>
    </div>
    <p> <strong> Carbon intensity of electricity varies a lot, depending on its sources.</strong> Renewable and nuclear energy sources go as low as 10g CO2/kWh, whereas fossil fuels often reach as high as 200–400 g CO2/kWh.(58) Therefore, <strong>choosing a renewable energy powered hosting makes a significant difference in the impact of a website or an app</strong>. However, the servers should not be too far away from target users, as it takes a lot of energy to transmit data through the telecom’s networks. <strong>The further data travels, the more energy is consumed.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>When carbon intensity is combined with the calculation of energy consumption, carbon emissions of web products can be calculated</strong>. Following this method, Greenwood’s design agency Wholegrain Digital has created a tool called Website Carbon Calculator. Detailed information follows in the Measurement Tools section of this chapter.</p>
    <p> Another measuring method, as proposed by Tim Frick in Designing for Sustainability, is the lifetime cycle assessment (LCA). LCAs are also sometimes called cradle-to-grave (C2G) or cradle-to-cradle (C2C) assessments. <strong>By assessing the entire life cycle of products and services, organizations can identify sources of waste, and implement efficiencies to improve performance</strong>. Even though this is common in sustainability practices, <strong>LCA is rarely applied to digital products and services</strong>. When it is possible to measure how much use a web application gets across devices and platforms, it is also possible to estimate how much electricity it needs.</p>
    <p>LCAs entail the following steps:</p>
    <p> 1. Goal and scope definition — Define the environmental impact of our online properties and implement a plan for mitigating that impact.<br>
      2. Inventory analysis — Web, apps, cloud services, social media, and so on—what is included and what isn’t?<br>
      3. Impact assessment — How much CO2 is generated by these properties? Is there other waste, as well?<br>
      4. Interpretation — Create a plan to reduce impact — renewable energy, carbon offsets, increases in product/service efficiency, e-recycling, etc.(59) </p>
    <p> Life cycle inventories (LCIs) are where data is collected. On the internet, they are referred to as analytics. Frick notes that Google Analytics, the most popular analytics tool, measures everything except for the energy use. In his article Save the planet through sustainable web design, Dr. Pete Markiewicz proposes a framework for equating virtual LCAs to their physical counterparts:(60)</p>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Disposal</td>
        <td>Data erased from client</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    <h4>Software and Visual Assets</h4>
    <p><strong>Assessing, how energy-efficient the creation of a software is, can be very challenging, unlike calculations of the impact of manufacturing materials of a physical product</strong>. Frick asks the following questions which can help with the assessment:(61) If cloud-based services are being used, are they hosted on servers powered by renewable energy? If not, is there a tendency to leave applications open and running in the background? Were Lean Start-up principles used and only what was necessary to validate the product created or was the software package loaded with rarely used features? Are the software company’s offices powered by renewables? Is the equipment energy-efficient? </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Design and Development</h4>
    <p><strong>Significant energy savings and efficiency gains can be achieved through design and development.</strong> In the inventory analysis of a digital product or service’s design and development Frick suggests asking these questions:(62) Does the product use outdated or nonstandard technology that make hardware work harder, or requires plug-ins or other additional resources to run? Is it optimized for mobile devices? Are images, scripts, and other assets compressed or otherwise “minified” for fastest possible delivery?</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Server Uploads, Network Downloads</h4>
    <p><strong>Although digital products do not require packaging and shipping, they require energy to travel to their virtual destination.</strong> A large amount of electricity gets lost in transmission. According to Chint Global, the average loss of power between the power plant and consumers ranges between 8–15%.(63) Therefore it is crucial to calculate how much energy is lost in transmission on top of the energy which is used by infrastructure, bandwidth, and frontend use.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Interaction</h4>
    <p>To estimate the amount of energy caused by user interaction, Frick suggests asking the following questions:(64) How much traffic does the website or app get? How much of that traffic comprises computers versus mobile devices? How much energy do each of those devices use per second? Per minute? How much data is uploaded/downloaded per device per minute? What is the average amount of time spent (per device) using the digital product or service?</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Disposal of Data</h4>
    <p>Whereas recycling plays an important role in the inventory analysis of a physical product and the energy use needed for its disposal, for virtual products recycling is not a viable solution. Frick writes on the topic of data disposal:</p>
    <p>“With a virtual product, recycling isn’t an issue, though churn can leave residual data for closed accounts in databases, increasing an application’s size and hence footprint. On the frontend, power is used to delete applications or documents, though that is minimal in comparison to usage and interaction. Also, many online systems, like Git, for example, back up data rather than deleting it. So, if you store thousands of backups, even if only changes are stored, does that increase electricity use and hence environmental impact while also decreasing efficiency? Although disk storage might be energy efficient, backup management might be inefficient. […] Some questions to ask include the following: What processor resources are required to delete my application? Does it leave residual information on the user’s device? How many unused accounts are in the database?”(65) </p>
    <p> <strong>Calculating greenhouse gas emissions is a crucial part of every life cycle analysis</strong>. The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol is the most widely used international accounting tool for government and business leaders to understand, quantify, and manage greenhouse gas emissions across a product’s life cycle. “GHG Protocol establishes comprehensive global standardized frameworks to measure and manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains and mitigation actions.”(66) </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Benchmarking</h4>
    <p><strong>Benchmarking is the practice of comparing business processes and performance metrics to industry bests and best practices from other companies.</strong>(67)  Benchmarking improvement (comparing results against one’s own previous measurements, and those of the competitors) is crucial for sustainability goals. It is important to decide which metrics are of key focus and most relevant to any given project. Greenwood writes on the subject:</p>
    <p>“For each metric, the ideal figure to minimize emissions would be zero. The ideal amount of data transfer to minimize emissions is 0 KB, the ideal amount of data storage is 0 MB, and the ideal distance from data center to web visitor is zero miles. […] If all the figures are zero, then the carbon emissions will also be zero. […] It might be true that the most ecofriendly website is the one that doesn’t exist, but as web designers and developers, that’s not particularly helpful advice. We therefore need to use these metrics to challenge ourselves to see how low we can go without compromising the core requirements of the products we’re creating.”(68) </p>
    <p>Greenwood further recommends the <strong>f</strong><strong>ollowing steps for setting a sustainability budget</strong> for each chosen metric:(69) </p>
    <p><strong>1. Benchmarking</strong> – Measuring the relevant metrics of equivalent webpages, for example the current version of a page being redesigned, and/or the equivalent pages on competitors’ websites. This shows the variation within the given industry for presenting equivalent information..</p>
    <p><strong>2. Estimating what is possible</strong> – The benchmark established shows what has currently been achieved, but not what is theoretically possible. It is important to estimate what is theoretically possible in a best-case scenario.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Setting the budget </strong>– When the current best practice and the theoretical best-case scenario in a given sector is known, a budget for the chosen metrics can be set. If the best in the industry is close to the theoretical best case, there might not be enough room for improvement, but if there is a huge gap between these two figures, then new standards for the sector can be set. The budget for each metric should be achievable.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Setting a stretch goal </strong>– This is a goal that exceeds the budget and pushes the product creator to deliver higher levels of efficiency. Achieving it is a challenge which comes with difficulties but is theoretically possible.</p>

    <h3> Tools and resources</h3>
    <p>This section provides an overview of tools for measuring web impact and checking for green hosting.</p>
    <br> 
    <h4>Sustainable Web Design’s Formulas – <a href="https://www.sustainablewebdesign.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.sustainablewebdesign.org </a></h4>
<p>Sustainable Web Design is a platform which was created by combined efforts of Wholegrain Digital and Mightybytes, in collaboration with Medina Works, EcoPing, and the Green Web Foundation to define new open standards for estimating carbon emissions from digital products and services. They provide formulas for calculating emissions of digital products based on latest scientific research.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Ecograder – <a href="https://www.ecograder.com">www.ecograder.com</a></h4>
    <p>In 2013, Tim Frick’s digital agency Mightybytes released the first version of Ecograder. To address the environmental impact of websites, Ecograder helps people better understand, track, manage and reduce digital footprint of web pages. In 2022, an updated version of this tool was released. The 2022 Ecograder utilizes CO2.js from The Green Web Foundation, as well as Google Lighthouse's open-source page metrics, to identify areas for improvement. Ecograder’s carbon accounting includes percentage estimates for consumer device use, network use, data centre use and hardware production.(70)  Ecograder’s report gives a score on a scale from 0 -100, the amount of CO2 generated by a single page view, a monthly amount of CO2 emissions based on a pageview range selected at the start of the process, and individual scores and tips for improvement of the following categories: user experience (page rendering, page interaction, SEO optimization, accessibility), reducing page size (optimizing media, reducing page weight, removing unused code), optimizing performance (by reducing server requests) and green hosting. </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Website Carbon Calculator - <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com">www.websitecarbon.com</a></h4>
    <p>This tool developed by Wholegrain Digital measures the data transfer over the wire when loading a web page, calculates the amount of electricity used and converts it into a figure for CO2. It factors in whether the page’s web hosting is powered by renewable or standard bog energy. Website Carbon Calculator lists these five data points as used for their calculation: data transfer over the wire, energy intensity of web data, energy source used by the data centre, carbon intensity of electricity and website traffic.(71)  The report includes a total score which compares measured website with results of all websites tested with the tool, a calculation of the amount of CO2 emissions from a single page view and whether or not the hosting is powered by renewable energy. After that, it provides information about how much pollution the website would cause in a year, given an arbitrary monthly page views of 10 000. </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Ecoping – <a href="https://ecoping.earth">https://ecoping.earth</a></h4>
<p>EcoPing creates a daily website carbon report to help businesses improve their websites. Similarly to Ecograder and Website Carbon it uses the CO2.js from The Green Web Foundation. The report is split into three sections: </p>
    <p> 1. Overview – A quick look at how good or bad in terms of sustainability the website is. The overview features a total EcoScore based on carbon intensity and Google Lighthouse scores, amount of carbon emissions produced by each page view, amount of data transferred over the network, number of resources loaded by the page, load time, number of requests made to load the website, countries that the resources came from, CO2 intensity of the grid where the resources came from and an overall percentage of how low-carbon the site is.</p>
    <p>2. Insights – Information about the website and hosting, features a table that shows the daily change of resources of a website and total page size as well as a resource locations table which shows where all the resources that a website needs to run come from around the world.</p>
    <p>3. Actions – List of recommendations of various developers’ tasks to improve website.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Digital Beacon – <a href="https://www.digitalbeacon.co">www.digitalbeacon.co</a></h4>
    <p>Developed by Aline, a digital sustainability consultancy, this is yet another website emission estimating tool. Digital Beacon provides a thorough report with information about the total emissions and data transferred in for both first time and returning visitors, an overall page rating on a 5-level scale from bad to amazing, emission calculation based on monthly visits (with adjustable ratio of new and returning visits), a page size breakdown table, history of tests, information about core web vitals and tips for improvement.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Energy Impact monitor – Safari → Develop → Show web inspector → Timelines → CPU → Energy Impact</h4>
    <p>It is difficult to measure website energy consumption on end user’s devices because there exist many different models of devices. The Energy Impact monitor inside the developer console of Safari browser measures the percentage of CPU used, and the duration of its use when loading a website. It then generates an energy impact rating based on the data. However, it does not provide specific information about the amount of electricity in kilowatts. </p>
    <br>
    <h4>The Green Web Foundation - <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org">www.thegreenwebfoundation.org</a></h4>
    <p>The Green Web Foundation‘s mission is to track and accelerate the transition to a fossil-free internet. It offers a check whether a website is hosted by renewable energy or not. It also provides Green Web Browser extensions, which shows green status of every visited website, and every link on a given page. For automating checks, they also offer a Green Web API.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Tools for measuring CO2 emissions of digital products are still scarce as using them is not a common practice in most business. Raising awareness about the environmental impact of the web still has a long way to go. Understanding, correctly measuring, minimizing and offsetting that impact is crucial in the fight against climate change.</strong> Tim Frick hopes it becomes the norm for businesses: “Although it might not be the norm today, assessing the impact of a company’s digital products and services will hopefully be just one common future component of greater sustainability initiatives in business.”(72) The next chapter will provide practical methods on how to minimize the impact.</p>

    <h2> 2. How to build websites sustainably </h2>
    <p>“All design and all making is really a statement of the future, whenever we design, whenever we create, we are making a claim about how we should interact with technology in the years to come. And therefore, by extension how we should interact with each other, with our governments, society and planet. At the same time, we are making that decision, we are discarding thousands of alternative futures. Therefore, design has a clear ethical component because we are making a case about how we should all live.”(73)</p>
    <p> Cennydd Bowles </p>
    <br>
    <p>This chapter will provide practical, tangible information on how to plan, design, develop and publish websites in a more sustainable manner. The methods and practices described are suggested by web design professionals as well as pioneers in the relatively new field of sustainable web design. Graphic designer Jacob Cass introduces the following definition of sustainable web design:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“<strong>Sustainable web design takes a minimalist approach towards building websites. This means that unnecessary elements are replaced with intuitive, on-point, lightweight design solutions. In short, the principle of “less is more” applies</strong>.”(74) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Tim Frick, a certified sustainability designer, defines sustainable web design as follows: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“<strong>Sustainable web design is based on standard environmental conservation principles that can be applied to the life cycle of a digital product, service, or any type of online media.</strong> These principles maximize the efficiency of the web applications and media we create, reducing their carbon footprint and decreasing environmental impact. Sustainable web design principles generally focus on reducing electricity use but also cover the inclusion of “green” ingredients, such as clean energy–powered web hosting, for example. These principles also help users make more sustainable choices and meet their needs quickly.”(75) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Tom Greenwood’s defines sustainable web design and stresses the importance of a sustainability specialist in a project:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“<strong>Sustainable web design is an approach to designing web services that prioritizes the health of our home planet.</strong> At its core is a focus on reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption. What we need in every web project is a sustainability champion: at least one person who understands the issues, has some ideas for potential solutions, and can guide and encourage their fellow team members to consider sustainability at every stage of the project.”(76) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Energy efficiency is a concept which is only beginning to be applied in web design. <strong>As a rule of thumb, the more efficient a web page is, the more sustainable it is. </strong>The faster users can access content and perform the task they set out to do when visiting a page, the less energy is consumed. In order to design more sustainable digital products, new frameworks need to be implemented to allow web creators to communicate with stakeholders about the environmental impact of their products and services. Greenwood argues that radical changes are necessary in order to tackle the issues of web (un)sustainability:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“<strong>Radical and fundamental changes are what we need at this point to make sustainability part of the very fabric of design. That means we need to think about sustainability more deeply and be prepared to question the way that we have always done things.</strong>”(77) </p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Agile workflow methodologies and practices tend to be much more sustainable than the waterfall method of development.</strong> By implementing feedback, frequently testing, communicating with team and client throughout the project, web teams are able to respond to change quickly and easily, and thus avoid waste in the form of wasted time, effort or code.</p>
    <p>Since the majority of users access information on mobile devices, <strong>mobile-first principles and responsive design are at the core of web sustainability</strong>. If websites are not optimized for mobile use, data transfer, and therefore also energy, is wasted.</p>
    <p>Looking back at the findings of chapter 1.1, it must be stressed that <strong>even with implementing these methods, the websites and digital products will not be 100% sustainable, as they will still require the use of resources. </strong>However, the impact can be significantly minimized by applying the practices that will be listed in this chapter. The chapter is divided into sub-chapters with sustainable practices in terms of content, information architecture and user experience, user interface design, development, green hosting, and offline impact. At the end of each section a list of best practices is provided.</p>

    <h2> 2.1 Content </h2>
    <p><strong>Following a minimalist approach when creating and publishing content should be the primary principle in web sustainability.</strong> In the information overload that internet users experience daily, cutting content to a minimum is often highly desirable and appreciated. It is common for website owners to want to include too many unnecessary elements and information which is not all that relevant to the user or customer. </p>
    <p>There is a big difference between how designers and website owners think people use websites and how people actually use them. UX specialist Steve Krug writes: “One of the few well-documented facts about web usage is that <strong>people tend to spend very little time reading most websites. Instead, we scan (or skim) them</strong>, looking for words or phrases that catch our eye.”(78)  There are almost always large parts of the page that people do not even look at. Most users will look at each new page, scan some of the text, and click the first link that piques their interest or resembles what they are looking for. Krug argues that <strong>most text is just taking up space and scares users</strong>:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>"When I look at most web pages, I'm struck by the fact that most of the words I see are just taking up space, because no one is ever going to read them. And just by being there, all the extra words suggest that you may actually need to read them to understand what's going on, which often make pages seem more daunting than they actually are.”(79) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Krug’s famous advice to content creators is: Avoid half of the words on each page. <strong>One should omit all superfluous words</strong>. When the text is reduced, the following is achieved: page noise reduction, useful content becomes more prominent, the page becomes shorter, allowing users to see more of each page at once.</p>
    <p><strong>Reducing text and content in general is not only going to improve the user experience but is also in line with a more sustainable approach.</strong> Greenwood writes: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Implementing a minimalist approach is hard. It involves a degree of ruthlessness to cut things out and say no to ideas that can’t be justified. It requires us to not give every idea and every piece of content the benefit of the doubt, but instead to say, “If in doubt, we’re going to leave it out.”(80) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Greenwood notes that one of the best examples of a minimalist approach is the Google homepage. It focuses on the core functionality of the service and the design and features are stripped to a bare minimum. It gives users a positive user experience by providing exactly the functionality they need.</p>
    <p>Another good way to minimalize the impact of the web is to <strong>consolidate content to a single page, or the minimum number of pages possible</strong>, as each time a user visits a new page, a number of requests is sent to load images and features from a server. Placing more content on a single page seems to be good for SEO as well. According to research by Backlinko, <strong>long-form content scores higher in Google rankings and outperforms shorter content</strong>.(81) Similarly, spending longer time on a single page increases the dwell time, which translates to better rankings as it suggests that users find what they were looking for on a given page. </p>
    <p>Following a sustainable approach, <strong>it is also crucial to review and delete old, outdated, and useless content.</strong> This is often overlooked by many organizations and content publishers. Companies need to be aware of the digital footprint of digital files and develop systems for maintaining them properly. <strong>Review and removal should be thought of as processes that are just as important as publishing is</strong>. McGovern argues that “while the tools, systems and processes for publishing and storing are abundant and cheap, the tools and processes for review and removal of what is out of date are anemic and weak.”(82) Sometimes, in order to delete one page of a website, hundreds of other pages that link to the deleted page need to be changed.</p>
    <p> In order to avoid pages growing ever larger and servers getting fuller with useless old data, data review and maintenance should become an inseparable part of content creation. McGovern writes: “We must become much better at taking care of what we have rather than constantly creating new stuff.”(83) He also argues that published content gains a status of importance and relevance because of the assumption that if it is published it must be useful. He writes:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“It’s not that difficult to create or to add something. <strong>To remove what needs to be removed, to see what is unnecessary, what is getting in the way, that is such an unappreciated and deep skill.</strong> Not just that, to remove requires bravery. The old logic goes: “This thing is here. It must be useful.” Once things are created and published, they gain a status, an invisible protective layer. On the Web, a page can gain complexity over time because it exists within a network.“(84) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Most people who maintain web pages are not developers or designers and they might not be aware of how wasteful poor management of digital files and web pages can be. <strong>Regular audits of content and files should be commonplace in every organization</strong> to prevent old, useless data from sitting on servers.</p>
    <p>Another important topic in relation to content sustainability is its findability and strategy. <strong>The faster the content can be found by users, the less frontend energy is consumed, which makes it more sustainable</strong>. Following good SEO practices therefore corresponds with better sustainability. A combination of good SEO and an internal search on the website itself can help visitors reach results much faster. Frick stresses the importance of a good content strategy after the content is found:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“... it doesn’t end at search results. After it is found, your content should clearly and quickly serve its intended purpose and help users make more sustainable choices, too—like offering more sustainable shipping or highlighting more ethically produced products first. This requires good content strategy practices.“(85) </p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>On top of being easily findable and accessible, the content should provide value to the user, its purpose should be clear, helpful and engaging</strong>. Not only will it then be more sustainable and efficient, it will also be better in terms of usability, accessibility, user experience, and SEO. These practices go hand in hand in a goal towards a more sustainable, honest, clean and efficient web. It is important to note that most successful content strategies are the ones that are developed together with UX. </p>

    <h3>Best practice for content creators:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cutting content to necessary minimum</li>
      <li>Leaving unjustifiable content out</li>
      <li>Consolidating content to a single page, or as few pages as possible</li>
      <li>Reviewing and deleting of old, out of date content and files</li>
      <li>Following good SEO principles to make content easily findable</li>
      <li>Content should be valuable, and have a clear purpose</li>

    <h2> 2.2 Information architecture (IA) and user experience (UX) </h2>
    <p>As a large portion of the internet’s footprint occurs on the frontend, information architecture and user experience design can make a significant difference on the environmental impact of a web page. <strong>Good information structure together with streamlining workflows and user journeys can help reduce unnecessary page loads and corresponding data transfer.</strong> Frick writes on the subject:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Design and user experience (UX) are where the seeds of web sustainability are sown. Products and services that provide a streamlined yet enjoyable experience—putting the right things in front of users at precisely the moment needed and nothing more—are more efficient and more sustainable. UX designers are in a unique position to create tools with sustainability at their heart by streamlining user workflows, minimizing information overload, and removing potential distractions that keep users from accomplishing tasks they set out to do. In the case of sustainable UX, people-friendly is also more planet-friendly.“(86) </p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Reducing the number of pages users go through during their session helps to save energy and thus lower emissions.</strong> UX designers can make a significant difference by lowering the number of steps necessary for the visitors’ journey. It also corresponds to the practice of consolidating content to fewer pages mentioned in the content section of this chapter. Greenwood suggests that often the middle steps of a user’s journey are only benefiting the owner but not the user:</p>
<div class="quote">
      <p>“Identify whether there are any long user journeys that seem to be common amongst your users. Look at where they start, finish, and pass through. Are the middle stages genuinely useful steps in the journey, or are you forcing users to pass through those pages to get to what they really want? Gateway pages are often guilty of this.”(87) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Gateway pages are made for the purpose of drawing affiliate traffic and sending users along without creating unique value in content or functionality. This goes against the principles of UX. <strong>A good UX focuses on the needs of the users and provides them an intuitive and clear path to reach their goals.</strong> It avoids using so called “dark patterns” which are designed to trick users in order to improve the pages’ rankings or financial gains. An example of a dark pattern is changing the design pattern unexpectedly, such as suddenly changing a meaning of an established button (e.g. exchanging the word “next” with the word “buy”).</p>
    <p>Greenwood also mentions so called „Yoyo user journeys”, in which visitors keep returning back to a page and going out of it. This is most common for the homepage. This behaviour suggests that the user has reached a dead end in the journey and that the UX design did not insure for a smooth and frictionless continuity on the virtual journey. It is the job of UX designers to make sure this does not occur and that the least possible number of pages are loaded. B<strong>y collecting user feedback and analysing audience data, the user journey can be streamlined to save time and deliver resonating results.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Another practice to ensure optimal user experience for all users, no matter the quality of their device, browser or connection, is progressive enhancement. </strong>This is a strategy which emphasizes web content first. It allows all visitors to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, while users with additional browser features or faster internet connection receive the enhanced version instead..</p>
<br>
    <h3>Best practice for IA and UX designers:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Streamlining user journeys</li>
      <li>Avoiding long user journeys and gateway pages</li>
      <li>Avoiding yoyo user journeys</li>
      <li>Reducing unnecessary page loads</li>
      <li>Avoiding dark patterns</li>

    <h2> 2.3 User interface (UI) design </h2>
    <p>This chapter will focus on providing tangible information about reducing website emissions through implementing sustainable strategies in user interface design. It is divided into subsections about text, images, videos, colours, fonts, animations. </p>
    <p>Since page weight is mainly determined by various user interface elements, designers can contribute significantly to lowering website’s emissions by optimizing, reducing or omitting certain components in the design. <strong>Page size is also the main contributing factor to page loading speed.</strong> Large pages (larger than 3.49 MB) take 486% longer to fully load compared to smaller pages (smaller than 0.83 MB).(88) Therefore, the smaller in size the elements of a page are, the faster and more sustainable a page is. Good UI design should go hand in hand with content and UX strategies to deliver a quick, efficient, intuitive, helpful and satisfying experience to the user. <strong>UI elements should support a frictionless user journey.</strong></p>
    <p>Research by Google shows that <strong>pages with a high number of elements are worse at completing conversions</strong>, likely due to the fact that many assets are unoptimized, unmeasured, and unmonitored—and therefore unpredictable: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“We found that the number of elements on a page was the greatest predictor of conversions. And when we looked at entire sessions, pages that had more images and other elements led to fewer conversions. The culprit might be the cumulative performance impact of all those page elements.”(89) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Therefore, <strong>reducing the number of elements on a page is not only a more sustainable option, but also possibly more profitable.</strong></p>
    <p>In addition to reducing the number of elements on the page, designers should also reduce the number of “special effects”. <strong>Extensive use of animations, transforms, image carousels or parallax effects should be avoided as these are very energy intensive features.</strong> Greenwood notes that using a carousel instead of static images increases peak CPU usage by 7%, and a fade-in effect on page load increased peak CPU usage by 22%.(90) Apple’s showcase page for the iPhone 13 (<a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-13/">https://www.apple.com/iphone-13/</a>), is a good example of an extensive use of such effects. The result is an overwhelming and very polluting webpage.</p>

    <h3>Text</h3>
    <p><strong>The most environmentally friendly element of a website is text.</strong> Well written copy should be accompanied by good formatting to support users scanning the text and finding the right information. <strong>Proper formatting, such as using different heading sizes, splitting text into smaller, shorter paragraphs, highlighting keywords etc., is necessary for good readability and legibility.</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, text is largely being overshadowed by the extensive use of images and videos, which are the most polluting elements of the web. It is often presumed by web owners and creators, that images are more powerful communicating a message than text. McGovern gives a comparison of text and images in terms of total size:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“They say a picture paints a thousand words. Well, 1,000 words of text takes up roughly two A4 (210 mm wide and 297 mm long) pages and weighs about 6 KB. You’d place about four images that are 9 cm x 16 cm on two A4 pages. Let’s say these images are well optimized and weigh 40 KB each. (A poorly optimized image could weigh several megabytes.) Even with such high optimization, two A4 pages of images will weigh around 160 KB. That’s 27 times more than the two A4 pages of text. A 30-second video, on the other hand, could easily weigh 3 MB. Videos create massively more pollution than text. Text is the ultimate compression technique. It is by far the most environmentally friendly way to communicate. If you want to save the planet, use more text. Think about digital weight.”(91) </p>
    </div>
    <p>While it might be true, that <strong>in the age of information overload, people often prefer images over reading long texts, images often do not perform that well in generating conversions</strong>. This is especially true for generic stock images with no obvious connection to the digital product. McGovern gives multiple examples of cases where predominantly text-based versions of websites performed better than their image-ridden counterparts:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“In a test with an insurance company, it was found that a promotion for a retirement product was deemed less accurate when an image of a face was used than when text only was used. Another insurance company tested a number of treatments for a promotion. The text-only treatment outperformed the image-based ones four to one. Yet another insurance company tried two treatments of a page for getting a quote, one with an image, one without. The page without the image had a 166% higher conversion rate. An initiative by the UK government to get people to sign up to become potential organ donors tested eight approaches. The approaches that used images were least effective. Text-only worked best.”(92) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Given that a large percent of the population are visual learners, it often makes sense to accompany text with a corresponding image, but the content of the image should clearly support the story told by the text and not be there just for aesthetics. However, not all images are equally polluting, which will be discussed in the next section.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Best practice for text:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reducing text</li>
      <li>Formatting text to support scanning</li>
      <li>Using different heading sizes</li>
      <li>Highlighting important keywords and phrases</li>
      <li>Splitting text into smaller and shorter paragraphs </li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <br>
  <article id="ch2.3.2">
    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p><strong>Images play a critical role in storytelling, but since they largely contribute to websites’ footprint, they should be used sparingly and be as compressed and optimized as possible</strong>. As mentioned in chapter 1.2, images account for about 50% of the average page size (Fig 1.6). Greenwood writes that: “According to HTTP Archive, the median number of images on any webpage is approximately thirty, with a total transfer size of 1 MB—equivalent to one hundred fifty thousand words of lorem ipsum in an HTML file.”(93) </p>
    <p><strong>Extensive use of images seems to be not optimal for generating conversions.</strong> According to Google, the number of images on a page is the second biggest predicator of conversions. Sessions that converted users had 38% fewer images than sessions that didn't convert.(94) Pages that converted had an average of 19 images per page, whereas those without conversion did not, had an average of 31 images. </p>
<p> <strong>When images are necessary, they should be as authentic as possible.</strong> Many marketing studies and experiments suggest that <strong>using real images of real people instead of stock photos generates more conversions</strong>. McGovern mentions the following instances:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“A study by Marketing Experiments, in which a real photo of their client ran against one of their top-performing stock photos, found that there was a 35% higher conversion rate for the page with the real photo of the real person. A hair salon tested professionally-shot images of actors getting their hair done. It also shot basic images using a smartphone of ordinary clients getting their hair done. The images of ordinary clients vastly outperformed the professional images. A transport company used stock images and pictures of real drivers. The page with real drivers had a 38% improved conversion rate.”(95)</p>
    </div>
    <p>When designing a website, designers should ask themselves whether a full bleed image really adds value to the page, or if its purpose is purely aesthetic.<strong> Images which do not add value should be removed.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <h4>Image format</h4>
    <p><strong>Choosing the right format is crucial for reducing an image’s size and therefore emissions</strong>. Most images on the internet are a much higher quality than is necessary, which results in a slower experience for users. For raster images, WebP and AVIF are the most efficient formats in terms of quality/size ratio. </p>
    <p>WebP is an image format based on the VP8 video format which supports lossy and lossless compression, as well as animation and alpha transparency. Typically, <strong>WebP images are about 30 percent smaller than JPEG.</strong>(96) As of 2022, the format is supported by most browsers.</p>
    <p>AVIF is a newer image format, released in 2019, derived from the keyframes of AV1 video. <strong>AVIF generally has better compression than WEBP and can be less than half the size.</strong> However, AVIF is not yet supported by all browsers. A workaround to ensure that at least one supported image format is delivered to all browsers is to apply AVIF as a progressive enhancement (AVIF - if not supported → WEBP, if not supported → JPEG).</p>
    <p><strong>PNG or GIF are formats that are more efficient for flat images or graphics with block colours, like logos and icons, although they are inferior to vector-based SVG</strong>, which is the most efficient for flat graphics and even animations. SVGs can be very small in size yet they are infinitely scalable, and thus always sharp. SVG also has great browser compatibility.</p>
    <p>Given the fact that vector images are almost always significantly smaller, <strong>designers should consider using vector graphics instead of raster images whenever possible.</strong> Greenwood writes:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“We should also ask whether we can achieve the same or greater impact using other forms of styling instead of leaning on photographs. […] Can we use lightweight SVG vector files to illustrate ideas? Wherever we’re using images, we should challenge ourselves to imagine what alternatives exist.”(97) </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4>Compression and optimization</h4>
    <p><strong>After choosing the right image format, the images can usually be compressed further to get an even smaller size</strong>. Tools such as TinyPNG, Squoosh, Shortpixel, ImageOptim or Vecta compress file sizes without quality loss. For lossy compression, tools such as ImageAlpha convert PNG-24 to PNG-8 files, which included only the needed colour channels. Gzip compression helps images load more quickly on both desktop and mobile. </p>
<p><strong>Vector files can be manually optimized</strong> with help of tools such as Adobe Illustrator. Unnecessary groups and layers can be removed and shapes can be simplified by deleting anchor points. SVGs can be edited using a code editor too.</p>
    <p><strong>Raster images’ size can be significantly reduced by blurring of the photographs</strong>, as the file size is related to how detailed the photo is. JPEGs especially can be minified by blurring unnecessary details, as the amount of variation between each pixel reduces.</p>
    <p><strong>Increased margins or spacing between images in a layout can make a significant difference in file sizes. </strong>Greenwood notes that “pulling in the edges of an image and framing it with some space around it can actually make an image more impactful to the user while reducing the size of the image file itself.”(98) </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Responsive images</h4>
    <p>Using responsive images is a technique that is used to load the correct image based on device resolution, screen size and orientation and network connection. Multiple versions of an image are generated to fit different layouts. The ‘srcset’ and sizes attributes are then used in responsive markup to instruct browsers which image to load. <strong>Using responsive images improves user experience as images load fast and look sharp to the users.</strong> Greenwood warns about storing too many different variants of an image on a server using this technique and proposes focusing on the most common sizes: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“This can lead to significant savings in data transfer, but the question of how many different variations to account for remains, since each one we provide as an option is another image that needs to be stored on a server, which itself uses energy and hardware. The simplest approach is to make your best estimate for the most common viewport sizes your users will need, which should minimize the browser-side resizing.”(99) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Research by Backlinko suggests that using <strong>responsive images results in the best overall image loading performance</strong>, whereas the use of WebP format was significantly less effective at reducing image load times.(100) </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Best practice for images:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reducing of the number of images</li>
      <li>Using only images that add value</li>
      <li>Using images of real people instead of stock images</li>
      <li>Sufficient file formats (WebP, AVIF, SVG format)</li>
      <li>Using vector whenever possible</li>
      <li>Compression (TinyPNG, Squoosh, Shortpixel, ImageOptim, Vecta, ImageAlpha)</li>
      <li>Blurring photographs</li>
      <li>Greater spacing, smaller images</li>
      <li>Images properly sized for screen resolution (Responsive images)</li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <article id="ch2.3.3"> <br>
    <h3> Video</h3>
    <p>The use of video across the web is exploding. <strong>Over 80% of internet traffic is caused by video streaming</strong>.(101) Video content is in high demand, as can be observed on social media platforms such as Instagram or TikTok, in online advertising and also the rise of streaming services such as YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Disney+, HBO Max etc. <strong>From sustainability perspective, video is the single most polluting element of the web, because of its immense size</strong>. McGovern writes about the impact of video files versus text: “A 30-second video can easily weigh 3 MB, so one second of video costs 300 KB. 1,000 words of text is about 6 KB. Therefore, one second of video has as much impact on the environment as 50,000 words of text.”(102) </p>
    <p>Greenwood argues that the only reason images are the most polluting element of webpages is because most pages do not contain videos:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Images might be the biggest source of carbon emissions on most websites, but that’s because most websites don’t have videos — yet. For those that do have video, it will nearly always eclipse everything else on the website in terms of carbon emissions, as videos are both data and processing intensive. Streaming video is one of the largest sources of internet emissions, and it’s growing fast as we get accustomed to consuming more of our information and entertainment in video format. A study by the University of Bristol found that streaming videos from YouTube produces approximately 10 kg of CO2 per hour, or 2.8 grams per second."(103) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Therefore, the use of video should be avoided as much as possible. <strong>In case video content is needed, it should be kept as short as possible</strong>, since every second of a video is larger in size than a full screen wide image. </p>
    <p><strong>Video content is far from ideal in terms of practicality, as usually it gives users no possibility of skimming through, or scanning for relevant information</strong>. Greenwood writes that “with most web content, you can skim through it quickly and stop to study elements of particular interest to you. With video, you have to sit through it from beginning to end—turning users into passengers rather than drivers of their own experience.”(104)  Moreover, videos often have to be replayed to transcribe or note down relevant information, because of their fast pace, which leads to higher energy use. </p>
    <p>Providing relevant information only in form of video content is actually a disadvantage, since it is accompanied by sound, and is therefore not always usable in public spaces. The other reason is that it consumes a large amount data, which could restrict many users with limited mobile data only to be able to access this content on WIFI. </p>
    <p>Designs where the user has little or no control over video, such as an auto-play background video, should be avoided, as they are highly wasteful but potentially problematic for people with sensory disorders or motion sensitivity.</p>
    <p><strong>When video content is necessary, it should be properly optimized to reduce its’ size.</strong> The most efficient format for video is MP4, as it is not only the most supported format for the web, but also has the best quality image/file size ratio. For video codecs, H.264 is the best option, as it has the widest support and it offers an above-average balance between video quality and file size. Video files can be further compressed using tools such as MP4compress, Clideo and many more.</p>
    <p>Greenwood also argues that in many cases, a simple animation is more practical and efficient: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“On reviewing the requirements, we found that interactive web animation would be a better solution, with accessible text, better mobile usability, the ability to click in and out of different stages of the process, and smaller file sizes. By adapting an After Effects animation for the web using Lottie, we were able to create an interactive animation in just 575 KB—far more efficient than the 13 MB we’d estimated for a well-optimized video offering the same information.”(105) </p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>For animations, MP4 or WebP are both more efficient than GIF, and they both deliver better quality in smaller file sizes. </strong>MP4 has better accessibility features such as audio description tracks and captioning. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Best practice for video: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoiding videos unless necessary</li>
      <li>Shortening videos to minimum</li>
      <li>Avoiding designs that involve auto-playing video, such as video backgrounds</li>
      <li>Optimizing and compressing video files to reduce file size without losing image quality</li>
      <li>Using WEBP or MP4 instead of GIF animations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Colours</h3>
    <p>When it comes to colours, there are multiple ways to reduce carbon footprint of a page. <strong>One of the practices that has gained a big significance in the last years is the use of darker colours or dark mode. </strong>Since most modern smart phones, laptops and TVs are equipped with an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screens, which illuminate each pixel individually, the use of darker colours in user interface has become energy efficient again. That was not the case with LCD displays, where the entire panel needs to be lit and the light source is shining at 100% the whole time. With OLED screens power only goes to the LEDs that need it and pixels can be turn off completely when there is black in the picture, or shine less where there are darker colours.</p>
    <p>According to Google’s research, <strong>the screen itself is one of the biggest drains on battery in smartphones</strong>, so by using darker colours designers could minimize the screen's power usage. They also found that using Google Maps in night mode caused the display's power usage to fall by 63 percent compared to the normal bright mode. Night mode didn't use any less power on an iPhone 7 with an LCD screen.(106) </p>
    <p>Colour can also make a difference, as <strong>blue pixels consume about 25% more energy than red or green pixels</strong>. To create blue light a higher energy transition is needed because blue photons carry more energy and have a higher frequency. For red or green light a smaller amount of energy is carried by every photon as they have greater wavelength.(107) </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Best practice for colours: </h3>

    <h3>Fonts</h3>
    <p><strong>Fonts can also have an influence on the environmental impact of a website, as they can be a significant portion of data transfer</strong>. According to McGovern they take up around 3% of data transfer on an average website.(108) <strong>The most energy efficient option for designers is to use a system font</strong>, as they are installed on user’s devices and therefore, do not require any data to load.</p>
    <p>In many web projects, the use of custom fonts cannot be easily avoided, for example because of company branding. Custom font use has been on the rise since 2011 where support for custom fonts was supported across the big four browsers; Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari and Firefox. As a result, custom font use has grown by 850% between 2011 and 2018.(109) </p>
    <p>When using custom fonts, there are multiple ways to reduce their impact. Greenwood advises to be strategic about their use and to<strong> avoid subscription fonts</strong>:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“When you do use high-impact non-system fonts, it helps to be strategic. Headings and menus, for example, tend to command much more visual weight than body text, so an eye-catching font is likely to have more impact there; users may not even notice you then use system fonts for the body copy. Other key considerations include whether your preferred typeface is available as a standalone webfont whose files you host directly, or if it’s licensed via a subscription font service such as Adobe Fonts or Fonts.com. These subscription services can add extra weight to your website and make additional server requests, increasing energy consumption and slowing your site down, while also limiting the extent to which web developers can optimize the fonts.”(110) </p>
    </div>
    <p>A typical custom font file’s size can be over 200 KB. <strong>Even though one custom font does not have a big impact on page size, using more than one custom font or multiple variations (weights) of a font can quickly add up to a significant bloat of page weight</strong>. Greenwood recommends using a smaller number of fonts for better clarity and consistency, and mentions the use of variable fonts in projects where larger variety is needed:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Reducing the number of font files makes pages faster and cleaner, and helps make your designs more consistent. <strong>In cases where your project genuinely does need a wide variety of font styles, consider using a variable font.</strong> Variable fonts are designed to allow precise scaling of thickness and slant, allowing infinite variations of a single typeface to be rendered from a single font file. It’s a highly efficient solution, and the main downside is the limited number of variable fonts currently available.”(111) </p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>A maximum of 2-3 fonts is recommended by most web professionals.</strong></p>
    <p>To avoid performance problems, <strong>web safe fonts are recommended</strong>. Web safe fonts appear across all operating systems. They’re the small collection of fonts that overlap from Windows to Mac to Google. These typefaces are already stored in a users’ browser, therefore do not need to be downloaded.</p>
    <p>Once the fonts have been chosen, there are ways to optimize them and reduce their size. <strong>Font files’ size can be reduced by compressing them to the most efficient formats, such as WOFF and WOFF2</strong>. Wholegrain Digital demonstrates that by converting TTF file to WOFF and then to WOFF2, they reduced the file size by 60% from 298kb to 114kb.(112) Tools like Fontsquirrel’s Webfont Generator (<a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator">https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator</a>) can be used for converting fonts.</p>
    <p><strong>Another technique to reduce font file size is to subset fonts, removing all unnecessary characters from the font file.</strong> This can be done using tools such as the Font Subsetter (<a href="https://everythingfonts.com/subsetter">https://everythingfonts.com/subsetter</a>).</p>
<br>
    <h3>Best practice for fonts:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Using system fonts if possible</li>
      <li> Hosting your fonts when possible, instead of using subscription services</li>
      <li>Limiting the number of fonts used, especially if using custom fonts</li>
      <li> Reducing font weight and style variants</li>
	<li> Using variable fonts, when more weights and styles are needed</li>
      <li> Using web safe fonts</li>
      <li> Using most efficient file format (WOFF2)</li>
      <li> Subsetting fonts - removing unnecessary characters</li>

    <h2> 2.4 Development </h2>
    <p>This chapter will provide information about how web developers can minimize webpages’ environmental impact and maximize efficiency by implementing various techniques for optimization, choosing the right programming language, content management system (CMS), or tools </p>
    <p>Many developers and designers have been working in ways that produce unnecessarily large, inefficient and polluting websites and web applications, without any awareness of the issue of environmental impact. These practices are not only harmful to the environment but also exclude users with slow connections and/or old devices. McGovern argues that this is due to developers and designers living in a high-tech bubble: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Many digital designers and developers ignore ordinary people living on ordinary wages. Not because designers and developers are bad people. No. It’s because most digital professionals live in a high-tech, large-screen, high-resolution, unlimited, high-speed bandwidth bubble.”(113) </p>
    </div>
    <p>But <strong>designing and developing with unlimited resources in mind means not providing equal accessibility to everyone and also ignoring and unnecessarily wasting our planet’s limited resources</strong>. The practices in this chapter should provide a comprehensive guide to developing a leaner, cleaner, healthier, more efficient, more accessible and more reliable internet.</p>
    <p><strong>The ability to write clean code is essential to sustainable development. </strong>Greenwood writes on the topic and raises many important questions: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Aside from the general benefits of reliability, security, and maintainability, well-written code is inherently more efficient. If you can write in ten lines of code what you used to write in a hundred lines, you’ve not only reduced the size of the file, but likely reduced the amount of work the server has to do to process that file. Think about the way you write code from a structural point of view. Can you organize your files to be more streamlined and avoid duplication of styles and functions? Can you simplify logic to reduce the number and complexity of queries required to deliver a specific piece of functionality? Can you code the website without using bloated libraries and plugins that contain functionality you don’t even need?”(114) </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4>Programming languages in comparison</h4>
    <p><strong>There are differences when it comes to energy intensity of different programming languages</strong>, which was the research topic of a 2017 paper titled Energy Efficiency across Programming Languages. The study found significant differences in energy efficiency and even though the results varied depending on the context, compiled languages showed the best energy efficiency:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Compiled languages tend to be, as expected, the fastest and most energy efficient ones. On average, compiled languages consumed 120J to execute the solutions, while for virtual machine and interpreted languages this value was 576J and 2365J, respectively. This tendency can also be observed for execution time, since compiled languages took 5103ms, virtual machine languages took 20623ms, and interpreted languages took 87614ms (on average).”(115) </p>
    </div>
    <p>The research found that the top 5 languages that need less energy and time to execute the solutions are: C (57J), Rust (59J), C++ (77J), Ada (98J), and Java (114J). Java is the only language of these, that is not compiled. The least energy efficient languages were all interpreted: Perl (4604J), Python (4390J), Ruby (4045J), JRuby (2693J), and Lua (2660Js). Thus, choosing the right programming language can make significant difference in energy consumption of a website.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>JavaScript</h4>
    <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in website and mobile application development. From an efficiency point, it is superior to PHP or Python, which are also commonly used for web development. According to the study, JavaScript uses just 4.5J to complete an average task, whereas PHP uses 29.3J and Python 75.9J.(116) <strong>JavaScript consumes only 15% of the energy of PHP, and only 5.9% of energy consumption of Python. </strong> </p>
    <p> But JavaScript can also get energy intensive, and it is growing quite rapidly in size. McGovern writes:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Between 2011 and 2019, JavaScript file size grew by over 600%, from an average of 52 KB to 370 KB. 1 KB of JavaScript creates far more pollution than 1 KB of text, because the JavaScript is setting in train a range of energy-intensive processes. Generally, JavaScript is compressed when it is transferred. (Once it arrives in the smartphone or computer, and it is uncompressed, that 370 KB can easily become more than 1 MB.) For the average smartphone used in 2019, processing 370 KB of JavaScript could take up to 12 seconds. For older, slower phones, heavy JavaScript loads are either excruciatingly slow or else they freeze the phone entirely.“(117) </p>
    </div>
    <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that allows designers the implementation of complex features on web pages and is most commonly used for animating elements. Even though it is quite energy efficient, <strong>the use of CSS instead of JavaScript for animation is always a more sustainable solution.</strong> Greenwood argues that: “CSS can now achieve many animation effects with far more efficiency than JavaScript because it minimizes the need for the CPU to “think”—and can generally be achieved with far smaller file sizes, minimizing the energy used to transfer data.”(118) </p>
    <p>Another common use for JavaScript is for advertising and tracking scripts. These can vary in size greatly from 1-75KB. <strong>Tracking scrips should be used with caution as they add size and complexity to the website</strong>, and can distract users from achieving their goal, or scare them off completely through being an invasion of privacy. Greenwood recommends asking which data is actually needed to be tracked and reducing the script to a minimum. According to httparchive.org, sessions with more scripts were less likely to convert. After about 240 scripts, conversions start to fall.(119) <strong>T</strong><strong>hird-party scripts also significantly slow down the loading speed. </strong>According to Backlinko, each third-party script increases load time by 34.1 milliseconds.(120) Tammy Everts and Katie Hempenius warn to be cautious about the use of JavaScript as it can cause performance problems, they write:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“JavaScript matters. A page can have a relatively low JavaScript weight but still suffer from JavaScript-inflicted performance problems. Even a single 100 KB third-party script can wreak havoc with your page. The more scripts on your page, the greater the risk. It’s not enough to focus solely on blocking JavaScript. It’s possible for your pages to contain zero blocking resources and still have less-than-optimal performance because of how your JavaScript is rendered. That’s why it’s so important to understand CPU usage on your pages, because JavaScript consumes more CPU than all other browser activities combined. While JavaScript blocks the CPU, the browser can’t respond to user input. This creates what’s commonly called “jank”: that annoying feeling of jittery, unstable page rendering.“(121) </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4>HTML and CSS</h4>
    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the original standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is the most basic building block of the web. It describes and defines the content of a web page along with the basic layout of the web page. McGovern notes that HTML code “can easily become bloated and needs to be carefully maintained and minimized”.(122) Tips and tools for minimizing code will be covered later in this chapter. </p>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is not a programming or markup language, but a stylesheet language that allows designers to specify the appearance of elements on the page. As mentioned before, CSS can also be used for animation, for which previously the use of JavaScript or Flash was previously required. CSS animations include text animations, colour animations, slide-in or slide-out animations, rotation, glow, bounce, fade-in or hover animations, and even parallax effect. CSS animations require less energy and processing than JavaScript. </p>
    <p>One practice that can help reduce the environmental impact is the use of CSS Sprites, a collection of images stored in a single image. CSS Sprites can be used to only load and display the needed image and thus lower the number of HTTP requests when loading the page.</p>
    <p>CSS, as any other code, can also become bloated if used as a framework, which will be discussed shortly in section Frameworks and libraries.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Frameworks and libraries</h4>
    <p>Both frameworks and libraries are useful and time saving for developers. <strong>Web frameworks and libraries provide fast access to common scripts and assets, and eliminate the need for developers to code features from scratch</strong>. A framework (e.g. Bootstrap, Vue, AngularJS) is a code structure or, a container, which needs to be filled with own code. A library (e.g. jQuery, React,) in contrast, is a structure that programmers need to build their code around. According to Freecodecamp:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>„The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.“(123) </p>
    </div>
    <p>However, <strong>web sustainability experts also warn against the use of frameworks and libraries, as they can cause performance problems due to the overhead of increased HTTP requests.</strong> If only a small portion of functions is needed, much of the code content of the framework or library is simply taking up space and resources. McGovern writes on the topic of the use of CSS frameworks:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“In using CSS, it has become convenient to apply what are called “frameworks.” These are all-in-one packages that contain all the CSS you might need to use and much, much more. These frameworks might load about 100 KB of CSS. In the grand scheme of things, that’s not much. However, when it comes to the Web, not every KB has the same impact. CSS must be downloaded first. Without it, the page can’t be displayed. CSS thus has a critical impact on what people see and how quickly they see it. It’s probable that most sites don’t need any more than 10 KB of the 100 KB downloaded.”(124)</p>
    </div>
    <p>Frick however points out that “when using a common resource like Google’s Hosted Libraries, if your own site has caching-enabled, it is likely that the end user might already have your script loaded into the browser, thus reducing the overhead of said HTTP requests.”(125)  Caching will be discussed at a later point in this chapter.</p>
    <p>When using a framework is necessary, developers can still make a more sustainable choice by choosing one that is more efficient than others. Backlinko compared the speed of different JavaScript frameworks and found out that Wink and Gatsby are the fastest, whereas Meteor and Tweenmax are the slowest. The fastest framework is 213% faster than the slowest.(126)  For CSS, mini.css is a framework that offers a wide variety of modern components, is optimized for responsive design and is smaller than 7KB.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Code compression</h4>
    <p> <strong>An important part of sustainable development is code compression.</strong> Developers often include elements in their code, which are of no use to computers, such as comments, white space between code, or long names for classes and functions. All these components are left unused when the website loads, but they still run and use up resources. Greenwood writes on the topic:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“If we can strip them out of our work and generate a version of our code that’s purely machine-readable, then we can save energy and improve web performance.<strong> Build tools help us do this by converting the development code we read and write as humans into a production-ready version optimized for machines</strong>. Build tools can be used for many things, including checking code against web standards and browser compatibility, but it’s their ability to compress code that we’re interested in here. It can be complicated to set up build tools because there’s a different tool for every optimization we want to apply. CodeKit is a piece of software written for people fed up with managing multiple open-source tools to produce a website build.”(127)</p>
    </div>
    <p>There are many tools that can be used to minify HTML, CSS and JavaScript instead of going through the code manually. They remove code comments, unused code, formatting, and shorten certain functions. There are many tools available, for example for HTML minification HTMLMinifier, for CSS CSSNano, CSSMinifier, UNCSS or CSSO and for JavaScript UglifyJS, Fast Velocity Minify or Closure Compiler.</p>
    <p><strong>Minifying code is especially important when a templated website builder (e.g., Squarespace, Wix, Elementor) is used.</strong> These builders make it easy for people without coding experience to build a website, but they might create messy code tand thus slow down the page significantly. </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Gzip compression</h4>
    <p><strong>Gzip is a file format and software application which locates strings of similar code in text files, then temporarily replaces them to make the files smaller before it is served to a client.</strong> It can make files up to 80% smaller, which results in improved page load time, decreased bandwidth consumption and reduced SSL (Secure Sockets Layer certificate) overhead. This works well with CSS and HTML, as these files often have repeated code and whitespace. The majority of web servers can compress files in Gzip format, with the help of either a third-party module or using built-in routines.(128) According to Yahoo, “<strong>Gzipping generally reduces the response size by about 70%.</strong> Approximately 90% of today's Internet traffic travels through browsers that claim to support Gzip.”(129)</p>
<br>
    <h4>Dynamic vs static websites</h4>
    <p>Nowadays most website are database driven, meaning that content, code and other components are stored and delivered from a database. Dynamic websites allow for the content of each page to be delivered and displayed dynamically, according to user behaviour or from user-generated content. All of the data and content are organized in a database or backend Content Management System (CMS), which connects to the website pages. McGovern writes:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“The pages on the site don’t actually exist permanently. Rather, when you click on a link for a page or type the URL in, the page is dynamically created, going into the database to fetch all the relevant content, code and components. A database website is very effective when things are likely to be constantly changing, for example stock levels for a particular product.”(130) </p>
    </div>
    <p>In contrast, static websites are made up of webpages created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Each page on is stored as an HTML file, which is delivered directly from the server to the webpage. These webpages permanently exist. <strong>Static pages generally have small files, load faster and require less processing, and are therefore more eco-friendly. </strong> </p>
    <p>McGovern argues that even though static websites perform better and are energy efficient, dynamic websites are preferred for the sake of innovation and novelty: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Static websites are faster. I have seen analysis that indicates that a static website can be up to 10 times faster than an equivalent database-driven site. In our analysis, when the page was static, 378 KB of data was being transferred. When the page was served from a database, 701 KB was being transferred. That’s almost twice the data transfer for a database-driven page. Imagine all the energy and time that could be saved if the millions of websites that don’t need to be database driven migrated to static? We must think about the energy. We must think about the data. We must think about the pollution. If static websites are better in many situations, why aren’t they used more? Why have we in fact moved in the opposite direction? “Progress,” “innovation,” the desire to be seen to be using the “latest” technology. A database is more “advanced” than a static website, and everyone wants to be seen as more advanced.”(131) </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4>Jamstack</h4>
    <p><strong>Jamstack is new standard architecture for the web. It combines the performance of a static website with advanced features of a dynamic website. </strong>JAM stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It is a way to decouple the content management system (CMS) from the front-end. <strong>Pre-rendered content is served to a content delivery network (CDN) and is made dynamic through application programming interfaces (APIs) and serverless functions.</strong> Greenwood writes: </p>
<div class="quote">
      <p>“A JAMstack website uses a content management system to edit and publish content, and then the web pages themselves prerender as static web pages. This approach delivers the performance, security, and energy efficiency of purely static web pages—and unlike the static websites of the early web, it can also deliver the rich interactions, advanced functionality, and CMS-based content editing we expect from the modern web. JAMstack websites typically also host the static files on a content delivery network (CDN), saving energy by reducing the distance files have to travel to each visitor and creating resilience by eliminating any single point of failure.”(132) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Because Jamstack pages use pre-built files served over a CDN, they are generated at deploy time, which significantly reduces time to first byte (TTFB). <strong>The distance for data travel is much shorter than traditional dynamic pages.</strong> There are many Jamstack frameworks and CMS such as Jekyll, Netlify, Gatsby, Next.js or Nuxt.</p>
    <p>According to Josh Lawrence, a static implementation of WordPress is likely to use several hundred times less energy than using WordPress in its default form.(133) </p>
    <p>Greenwood argues that from an energy efficiency standpoint, Jamstack is comparable to a well-cached CMS website. He writes that:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“The difference is marginal if you’ve set up your CMS to get everything working efficiently. The key difference is JAMstack has the efficiency benefits of static websites by default, whereas with conventional content management systems you have to pay attention to detail to ensure it’s all set up to perform efficiently, which is often not the case.”(134) </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4>Caching</h4>
    <p>There are different types of cache: site or page cache, browser cache and server cache. <strong>Caching is the process of storing copies of files in a temporary storage location (cache), allowing them to be accessed faster</strong>. Site caching is the concept of caching from the client’s side. With site caching, most of the page is downloaded when the first visitor visits the page for the first time. All subsequent visitors receive a cached version of the page, thus both transfer size and load time are significantly reduced, improving web performance and saving energy.</p>
    <p>Browser caching is also a type of site caching but built into the browser. Files and content are stored on user’s computer. Browser cache saves HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript scripts, images and other types of multimedia content. With server caching, content gets stored on a site’s server. Server caching is fully handled and administered on the server without involvement of the end-user or a browser.(135) Greenwood advocates for server caching as it reduces the number of requests: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“ … when we implement a caching solution inside our CMS, the CMS itself still has to fire up and process every request before sending the static files to the visitor. We can eliminate this initial overhead by moving the caching layer onto the hosting itself. The server sends the cached files directly to the user without querying the CMS, saving energy and improving load times even further. Server-side caching technologies like Varnish are widely available and come standard in some hosting packages, so even if you don’t have the technical knowledge to set caching up yourself, you can still apply it to your projects.”(136) </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4>Lazy-loading images </h4>
    <p><strong>Lazy loading is the practice of loading images only when they are needed, meaning until the user scrolls and they enter the viewport.</strong> It speeds up the initial load of the website, since less data needs to be downloaded. Device Atlas writes: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“If an image is not in the viewport, then it can’t be seen by a user, and if the user never scrolls down, then the image will never be displayed, so loading it is a waste of bandwidth. Although l<strong>azy-loading images won’t reduce the absolute size of a page, it will reduce the number of bytes downloaded in many cases, whenever only a portion of a page is downloaded</strong>. […] Of course, you don’t want the user to have to wait for an image to load every time he or she scrolls the page, so lazy-loading solutions can often be configured so that an image is loaded when it is within a certain pixel distance of the viewport.”(137) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Device Atlas also recommends the following tools and plugins to help with lazy-loading: PageSpeed (webserver module), Lazy Load, BJ Lazy Load for Wordpress, Image LazyLoader for Drupal, and bLazy for JavaScript.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Blocking bots</h4>
    <p>A significant amount of website traffic is caused by bots. They put additional load on servers and slow down websites. According to Akshat Choudhary, founder of the WordPress backup and security service BlogVault, <strong>bots are responsible for around 50% of processing and bandwidth resources.(</strong>138) Greenwood argues that the solutions are often very easy, with minimal effort and a big performance and efficiency gain: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“<strong>Bots can be blocked primarily by using a firewall</strong>, which can be added to most websites using a service such as Cloudflare or Malcare, or by your hosting provider. These services will block the majority of bots, but still let in the ones you want (hello, Google!). With this in place, you can not only reduce the carbon footprint of your website, you can also improve load speeds, enhance security, and stop competitors from scraping your information. Win!”(139) </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4>Comparing CMSs</h4>
    <p><strong>Choosing the right content management system (CMS) can also make a difference.</strong> Backlinko has compared the performance of common content management systems.(140) Weebly and Squarespace have the best overall speed performance, popular WordPress and Wix ranked among the worst.</p>
    <p>WordPress is the most popular CMS, which powers around 40% of all websites.(141) It has gained popularity for being relatively easy of use, big library of plugins and SEO options. When using WordPress, a more sustainable option is the use of a lightweight theme. </p>
    <p><strong>When it comes to web development, the most sustainable practices are tightly linked to speed performance, efficiency, smaller packages and shorter ways for data transfer.</strong> Energy savings can be made by implementing methods mentioned throughout this chapter that in turn make pages load and respond faster, have fewer errors and fewer lines of code. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Best practice for development:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Choosing less energy intensive programming language</li>
      <li> If possible, avoiding frameworks and libraries</li>

    <h2> 2.5 Green hosting </h2>
    <p>This chapter focuses on providing information about green (renewable energy powered) hosting, shared hosting and content delivery networks. Since the percentage of global energy usage of data centres is projected to grow, it is crucial that digital products and services are powered by renewable energy.</p>
    <p>Experts agree that <strong>hosting websites on servers powered by 100% renewable energy is the most important step towards web sustainability</strong>. To this day, however, there are many challenges connected to choosing a truly green host, including false marketing claims and greenwashing. Frick writes in his book Designing for Sustainability: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Although all the other techniques outlined in this book can help increase efficiency and reduce energy use, none are as effective at reducing environmental impact as where your power comes from. But not all renewable energy is created equal. Green hosting comes in several flavors, some of which are preferable to others. Whereas some hosting providers have the resources to build their own wind farms or solar arrays, others do not. They can, however, bring renewable energy to their customers through other methods, but these options are not without complications. Add to this the fact that marketing departments often make false claims of 100% renewable energy, further confusing this issue.”(142) </p>
    </div>
    <p>He further stresses the need for simple, clear option for green hosting of digital products and services. This is the mission of the Green Web Foundation. They have created a database of web hosting providers powered by renewable energy. </p>
    <p><strong>Since 2010 there has been a so-called “hyperscale shift”, meaning the rise of super energy efficient large data centers, which use a uniform, organized computing architecture which is easily scalable to hundreds of thousands of servers. Because of this shift, data-center electricity demand has remained almost the same.</strong> This shift was led by big tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, as they began to need large fleets of servers in the hundreds of thousands. Greenwood writes:</p>

      <p>“Hyperscale data centers embrace economies of scale to deliver lower costs, more advanced services, and higher levels of energy efficiency. On average, one server in a hyperscale data center is able to replace 3.75 servers in a conventional data center thanks to their highly optimized design. […] However, <strong>energy consumption is likely to begin increasing again</strong> as our industry finishes picking off most of the low hanging fruit to improve efficiency. Many data centers are now approaching the theoretical limit of power usage effectiveness (PUE), the standard measure of data center energy efficiency. As we approach this limit, it’s likely that efficiency gains will plateau and global energy demand from data centers will again start to rise in line with growing data consumption. The solution is twofold: we need to use the most efficient data centers we can find, but we also need to take responsibility for the applications we host, keeping energy requirements low to minimize their demand on servers.”(143) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Many big tech companies have made promises to be fully powered by renewable energy. Both Apple and Google claim to have reached their goals of 100% renewable energy in 2018.(144) Both Amazon and Microsoft have pledged to make their energy supply 100% renewable by 2025.(145)(146) However, the truthfulness of these ecological claims cannot always be easily proved.</p>
    <p>Even when data centres have their own solar panels, it does not mean they are directly powered by them. They are still connected to a larger energy grid from which they get electricity, making it impossible to differentiate what type of energy flows in. Apple, for example, pays off consumers and other companies to receive renewable energy credits for its fossil fuel generated electricity usage.(147) However, according to global energy initiative RE100, <strong>companies can claim 100% renewable energy when they match 100% of the electricity used with electricity produced from renewable sources (biomass + biogas, geothermal, solar, water, wind) – either sourced from the market or self-produced.</strong>(148) Therefore it is possible for companies like Apple to make these claims, without actually being powered solely by renewable energy. However, some argue, that since most of the energy used by a typical laptop or smartphone is consumed during its manufacture, these ecological claims are misleading.(149) </p>
    <p><strong>Powering data centres with renewable energy requires large investments in hardware, which might be out of reach for smaller companies.</strong> On top of that, for many companies investing in renewable powered data services is challenging due to political circumstances in the country. Frick argues that:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“… the political climate of many areas does not often favor renewable energy as a superior alternative to fossil fuels. For many data center operators, the local political environment and monopolistic utilities make moving to renewable energy a difficult proposition. Sometimes, the only way companies in certain markets can commit to renewables is to purchase unbundled renewable energy credits — a subpar solution ...“(150) </p>

    <h3>Types of green hosting</h3>
    <p><strong>It is not always clear what a hosting company means by saying it uses green or renewable energy.</strong> Greenwood advises that “the best way to find out what a web host’s green energy commitment really means is to ask them.”(151) Normally a combination of renewable energy contracts is used by most hosting providers. These are the types of contracts:</p>
<br>
    <h4>On-site renewables</h4>
    <p><strong>The energy used comes directly from solar or wind farm on site.</strong> This is the most robust solution, with absolute clarity of the source of energy. However, this option is not that easily practicable, as solar and wind are somewhat unreliable sources, therefore even with on-site renewables, data centres still rely on connection to the main electrical grid for back up or to cover all power needs. For small providers, this solution is likely cost-prohibitive.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Funding renewables</h4>
    <p> <strong> Hosting providers sign long-term contracts with energy companies to fund new renewable energy development</strong>, in exchange they are granted access to that energy when it is available. This is the best option without directly owning wind or solar. Frick writes:</p>
    <p>“Hosting providers can secure long-term contracts (often 10 to 20 years) with energy companies to provide renewable power for their data centers. The benefits of this arrangement are twofold: energy companies can use this purchase guarantee of both energy and renewable energy credits (also known as bundled RECs) to secure financing to drive development of additional renewable energy infrastructure while data centers can negotiate a price guarantee on electricity, thus protecting against future rate increases.”(152) </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Directly buying renewable energy</h4>
    <p><strong>Green hosting provides can buy energy directly from a provider who generates renewable energy on their electrical grid.</strong> This option, however, does not help generate more renewable energy. This direct access is not available is many markets. Greenwood argues that this option “should be the minimum standard of what can be claimed as ‘using renewable energy’.”(153) </p>
<br>
    <h4>Buying renewable energy credits (RECs)</h4>
    <p><strong>Renewable energy credits (RECs), also called guarantees of origin (GOOs) in Europe are purchased from renewable energy generators on other grids.</strong> The credits can be bought and sold, but are not connected to the actual electricity being used by the data centre. Often, buying RECs means finding renewable energy providers in other regions or countries and paying them to say the energy was generated for the buyer. Frick argues, that this option does not help to move towards the goal of a fully renewable-powered internet, as the credits do not displace energy from fossil fuels.(154) </p>
    <p><strong>The sustainability of the use of RECs is disputed by experts.</strong> Todd Larsen from Green America argues that the use of RECs can be both good and bad, depending on the context: </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“In some ways, [RECs] have made the rapid growth of clean energy possible, and used correctly, they can be advantageous. At the same time, RECs can be problematic and actually work against creating local, truly green sources of energy.”(155) </p>
    </div>
    <p>David Pomerantz of Greenpeace argues that only using RECs is a PR stunt:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“If you’re paying for the electricity along with the RECs, it’s a viable solution. But if you’re just buying the RECs alone, you’re not actually improving the situation. Companies that purchase RECs and not the electricity that comes with them are, in effect, just buying PR.”(156) </p>
    </div>
    <p>He further admits, that sometimes it might be the only affordable option. In those cases, the highest quality credits should be purchased.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Carbon offsetting</h4>
    <p>This is the least conscientious and viable option, where <strong>companies purchase carbon offsets to make up for the emissions caused by the use of fossil fuel energy</strong>. Greenwood says that: “In many cases, carbon offsets simply pay someone else to reduce their emissions so that you don’t have to. <strong>It doesn’t directly address the issue of data centers being powered by fossil fuels,</strong> even if it can have some other benefits.”(157) </p>
    <p>At this point, there are still policy changes needed to make renewable powered hosting a standard option. Often, green hosting is seen as a slightly more unreliable and expensive option. Moreover, many providers will not offer green hosting unless the majority of their customers demand it. </p>

    <h3>Shared servers</h3>
    <p>“Sharing is caring!”</p>
    <p> A popular idiom</p>
    <br>
    <p>Sharing a server, which otherwise would have been under-utilized, means caring for the environment. Most hosting providers offer this option. <strong>Shared (virtual) hosting is a way to host a website on a single physical server that also hosts other websites</strong>. Shared hosting takes advantage of a server’s optimal utility, as each website receives different amounts of traffic at different times. Since energy is being used by the servers even when it is not being used, shared hosting is a viable option for better sustainability. </p>
    <p>Asim Hussain, a green cloud advocate at Microsoft, argues that “<strong>the more you do use hardware, the more efficient it becomes.</strong>”(158) But <strong>there needs to be balance in the load of the servers</strong>. Greenwood writes:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“If we have minimal server requirements and no specific technical need to have our own dedicated server, then a shared solution is likely going to be more efficient, but only if our hosting company is distributing their customers applications across servers to balance the load effectively.”(159) </p>
    </div>
    <p>But <strong>experts also warn against overburdening or overutilizing servers, which is also inefficient</strong>. Overloaded servers generate a lot of heat, which wastes the server’s energy and requires even more energy for cooling down. Tim Nash argues that servers have an optimal load at which they run most efficiently:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“A server running overprovisioned will end up in locking processes, so its high CPU and memory usage will become constant, whereas if the load was balanced across multiple servers, that locking wouldn’t occur, memory gets released quicker, and the load is overall much smaller.“(160) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Greenwood also mentions that both under- or overutilization of servers are directly linked to the environmental impact of manufacturing servers, as underutilized servers are a waste of resources, and overutilized servers have a higher chance of breaking down prematurely.</p>
    <p><strong>Using a smaller server is another way to reduce emissions of a website</strong>. Greenwood recommends starting with a smaller server and sizing up in case of need, as hosting providers are less likely to help a company size down their server needs. He writes:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“If we can use a smaller server, then we can save energy and save money on hosting. We might feel a temptation to err on the side of caution and get a big server just to be sure it can handle our project’s requirements. But if we’ve worked hard to optimize the efficiency of our website through the design and development process, the server requirements in terms of both storage and processing will be a fraction of other similar websites. The only way to find the optimal server size is to start small and test. Your hosting provider will be only too happy to help you scale up if you need to, whereas they aren’t always so enthusiastic to help you scale down.”(161) </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4>Content delivery networks (CDN)</h4>
    <p><strong>A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.</strong> A CDN allows for faster transfer of assets needed for loading static content including HTML pages, JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, images, and videos.(162) </p>
    <p> Because a big portion of the energy used by a website comes from transmitting data through the telecommunication networks, <strong>CDNs are a good way to minimize the transfer distance by moving assets closer to the end user.</strong> Greenwood stresses the need for choosing the right CDN provider who is committed to sustainability:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“CDNs are a great technology to help make the web more efficient, but we should remember that although they don’t do the same data processing functions as standard hosting services, CDNs are themselves web hosts that store and serve a huge amount of data. You therefore should try to choose your CDN provider as carefully as you choose your main hosting provider and ensure they have a strong commitment to sustainability.”(163) </p>
    </div>
    <p>Finding a renewable powered CDN provider is not as easy as finding green hosting. Cloudfare is a CDN provider with centers all around the world, who pledges to purchase RECs to match 100% of the power in all their data centers and offices.(164) </p>
    <p><strong>Choosing a green hosting provider is indisputably the easiest and most effective way to reduce digital product’s footprint. </strong>However, simply using renewable energy might not be a sustainable enough in a world with increasing energy demands. <strong>Using less energy, in addition to using green energy, should be the goal of every web project striving for more sustainability.</strong></p>

    <h2> 2.6 Offline impact </h2>
    <p>The environmental impact of a project can be also lowered by implementing energy efficient solutions in the offline world. <strong>Creating an environmentally friendly working environment should be a big concern to every organization</strong>. Greenwood asks whether the emissions generated during the working process are not greater than those of the digital product itself:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“The embodied carbon of a website comes from everything we do in our day-to-day work—our computers, our lighting, our heating, our air conditioning, our commute to the office, our travel to see our clients and yes, those endless cups of tea and coffee. The question is, what has a bigger impact—the emissions from our digital products, or the embodied carbon resulting from our physical operations?“(165) </p>
    </div>
    <p>There are many steps organizations can take to minimize their operational carbon footprint, including the choice of energy efficient hardware and software, using environmentally friendlier appliances, furniture, building materials, lightning and heating in the office, recycling, composting, avoiding unnecessary business trips or meetings, using agile workflows, encouraging environmentally friendly ways of commuting or remote work. </p>
    <p>Frick notes that <strong>ecological working environments tend to have a positive effect on workers in terms of making more sustainable decisions in their private lives</strong>: “Folks who work in more environmentally conscious offices tend to make more environmentally conscious choices in their personal lives, as well,”(166) he argues.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Best practice offline:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Buying the most energy efficient devices</li>
      <li>Using a laptop instead of a desktop</li>
      <li> When possible, avoid using large screens</li>
      <li> Not using screen savers</li>
      <li> Closing browser tabs and programs which are not being actively used</li>
      <li> Setting monitors to go off after some minutes of inactivity</li>
      <li>Turning off computer at night or for longer periods of inactivity</li>
      <li> Installing energy efficient LED lights in the office</li>
      <li> Recycling bins in the office, composting food rests</li>
      <li>Powering offices with renewable energy</li>
      <li>Turning off heating when not necessary</li>
      <li>Purchasing furniture made from recycled materials</li>
      <li>Promoting commuting by bike, foot or public transport</li>
    </ul>
